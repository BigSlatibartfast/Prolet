    MASS WORK
    By the Communist Party of the Philippines
    Foreword
    In our mass work, we arouse, organize and mobilize the
    masses of workers, peasants, semi-proletarians andparticular sections of the petty bourgeoisie for the peoples national-democratic revolution. We also pay attentiondistinct social groups, Such as women, youth,fisherfolk and national minorities who form the
    indigenous peoples and minority nationalities
    Mass work is so important for the party"s successfulleadership of the revolution. The foundation of therevolutionary strength of the Party and the revolutionarymovement is laid down through this work. The essentialwork is carried out in the three principal tasks-theformation of the Party, the waging of the armed struggleand the formation of the national united front. The
    effective leadership of a proletarian party can be gleanedfrom the effectiveness of its mass work

==========第1页==========
    Our present study of mass work is the product of thedevelopment of revolutionary practice through the years
    Embodied in this study are the summing-up of the
    Central Committee in the document, Our Urgent
    Tasks, and the summing-up of the Tenth Plenum of the
    Central Committee of the Party
    This chapter is divided into five parts
    A Line and Orientation of Mass Work
    B Propaganda and Education Work
    C Organizing the Masses
    D Mobilizing thee Asses
    E Consolidation and Expansion
    A. Line and Orientation of Mass Work
    1. What are the principal objectives of mass work?
    Our mass work has three principal objectives. The first isto form, consolidate and broaden the revolutionary unity

==========第2页==========
    and strength of the people through the establishment ofthe organs of democratic political power in accordancewith the class line of the united front in the countrysidepeople " s committees in the cities, and massorganizations and mass movements in the countryside
    and the cities
    The second is to establish and consolidate the broadestand deepest foundations among the masses for theprotracted people s war. The people s war cannot beadvanced firmly without the strong support of the broadmasses of the people
    The third is to establish the broadest and deepestoundation for the formation of the Party among theranks of the people
    The Party 's implementation of mass work accords withthe carrying out of its central task of seizing politicalpower. In this work, the broadest foundations of theunited front, the people s army and armed struggle, andthe formation of the Party among the masses, areprepared

==========第3页==========
    2. What is the mass line 2
    The mass line is the basic Marxist-leninist principlewhich guides mass work and other tasks of the Party inadvancing the revolution. It is based and conforms
    thoroughly to the historical materialist outlook on society
    and revolution
    The fundamental teaching of mass line is for us to havecomplete trust and reliance on the masses. It emphasizesthat the revolution must depend on the masses of thepeople and on the mobilization of the majority. It
    Opposes pinning one s hope on a handful of eadersgeniuses, heroes or saviors. It upholds the view that themasses, and only the masses, are the makers of history
    At all times and places, the Party must ensure that allcomrades in whatever position of responsibility arelinked firmly with the masses. Each conirade must betaught to love the people and to listen to the voice of the
    masses; to unite with them wherever they are and tomingle with them instead of hovering above them: and to
    rouse them. or else, raise their political consciousness
    based on their level; to help them to organize themselves

==========第4页==========
    and to help them launch all the important struggles whichcan be launched at a given time and place
    Commandism and tailism both run counter to theaspirations of the masses. We will certainly be divorcedfrom the masses if we force them to do things which areagainst their wishes or if we do not like to advancewhenever they demand that we advance. These errors
    bring about certain failure and harm
    Commandism is not an issue of style in giving orders tothe masses. Even if we employ mild-mannered speechwe become commandist whenever we exceed the level ofpolitical consciousness of the masses and we go againstthe volition of the masses: this only shows the sickness
    of impetuosity. Commandists do not take the pains toteach and encourage the masses, and instead set taskswhich exceed the capability and preparedness of themasses through alternating directive and coercive meansin order to carry out the work
    Tailism in any kind of work is also wrong, because ittrails behind the level of political consciousness of themasses and goes against the need to provide leadership to

==========第5页==========
    the masses; this only shows the sickness of sluggishness
    It happens frequently that the masses overtake us, andthey are anxious to take actions. but the tailists areunable to provide leadership in these situations. As aresult of a lack of analysis, they set policies and taskswhich trail behind the capacity and preparedness of themasses and that which conditions call for. They areunable to lead because they often doubt and hesitate
    They express only the opinions of certain backwardelements, and they even mistake those to be the beliefs of
    thee masses
    In order to avoid commandism and tailism. comradesmust mingle among the masses and investigate. Inpracticing mass line, the correct political line is key,because it expresses the obiective aspirations and
    interests of the masses
    In practicing mass line in the concrete conditions of
    Philippine society, the firm adherence to the general lineof the people "s democratic revolution is key. It isnecessary to arouse, organize and mobilize the broadmasses of the people in order to advance the

==========第6页==========
    revolutionary anti-fascist. anti-feudal and anti-imperialistmovement. It is necessary to make them understand theline of the Party, and to put into practice in their actionsthe policies and struggles which the Party launches inaccordance with this line. The political line is the basicstandard which decides whether or not we err in our
    work
    Both Lefi and Right opportunist lines subjectivelydesire the rapid and early decisive victory of therevolution beyond the actual level of strength of therevolutionary forces. The balance of forces is wrongcalculated. exceeding the analysis of the actualconditions and preparedness of the masses and therevolutionary movement
    The Left 'opportunist line of launching confrontationalpeople s strikes (weigang bayan), with the attendantputschist partisan actions of bus-burning, bombing ofcertain foreign capitalist and government establishmentsin order to incite urban insurrection, places therevolutionary mass movement in the city in a state ofpolitical isolation, if not a passive position. The urban

==========第7页==========
    mass movement loses its legal and defensive characterand is separated from the spontaneous masses. The deceitof excessive prospecting is certainly followed in quicksuccession by frustration and dejection
    The Right opportunist line of untimely peasant uprisingsto upstage urban insurrection precipitated as reformismand putschism in the peasant movement. The peasantmovement was drawn towards a principally legal andopen form of struggle. Armed struggle was depreciatedinto a position that is secondary and only supportive ofthe principally legal mass movement. The victories oftwo decades of agrarian struggle will be renderedmeaningless. and the landlords will be exalted
    As a result of Left and Right opportunism, gravedisorientation and retreats developed in the conduct of
    our mass work in the countryside and cities. Many placeswere abandoned. and numerous mass organizations
    organs of political power and Party units were dissolved
    Old and more oppressive feudal and semi-feuda
    arrangements returned, along with criminality. Thedevelopment of mass work in the cities lost vigor as a

==========第8页==========
    result of campaigns and mass actions which tended towear down the people, in combination with putschistpartisan actions a la agent provocateur meant to incite
    Insurrection
    In order to regain strength, it is necessary to repudiatethoroughly the Left opportunist line of militaryadventurism and urban insurrectionist and the other
    Right opportunist error of capitulationism,parliamentarism and reformism
    3. How do we follow the revolutionary class line inmass work?
    The revolutionary class line distinguishes the true friends
    of the revolution from the real enemies. It establishes the
    reliance on the most basic classes and forces whilepersuading and uniting with the middle forces in order toisolate the diehard enemies. This principle is in accordwith the mass line and the political line of the Party
    According to the revolutionary class line. we give stress
    in our mass work as a whole to the toiling masses. Theline of the people s democratic revolution, on the other

==========第9页==========
    hand, establishes that the principal preoccupation of the
    Party is the mass work in the countryside, particularlyamong the ranks of the poor peasants, rural workers andlower-middle peasants
    In every place, it is necessary to know the classcomposition of the population; to determine therevolutionary and progressive classes, the middle forcesand the reactionaries: and based on this to attempt mass
    work which gives emphasis to the most basic and most
    numerous mass forces at any given Scope
    In order to strengthen further the movement of the toilingmasses, it is necessary to advance the movement ofwomen and youth. In the cities, it is necessary to giveparticular attention to the work among the ranks of theyouth-students, teachers and government employeeswhich are the most concentrated and most active sectors
    of the petty bourgeoisie
    4. Why is social investigation and class analysis
    important in mass work
    Social investigation means the investigation of the

==========第10页==========
    conditions of society. The analysis of classes is thecorrect means of investigating society
    In Marxist social investigation. the classes which
    comprise society are differentiated and studied in theirrelations in the economy, politics and culture. The aim ofour study and analysis is the condition of the people as awhole and the masses with whom we work in particular,because they are the source of our concrete data and
    information-their condition is the particular obiect ofour study and analysis. Here, we apply theprinciple, concrete analysis of concrete conditions
    By means of social investigation and class analysis. weare able to grasp the concrete class outline of society, thecondition of the classes, and their real relations with each
    other, Thus. we are able to set the correct orientation for
    our mass work, We are also able to determine the
    appropriate forms and means of propaganda, organizingand mobilization of the masses. Without a correctthorough and comprehensive social investigation andclass analysis. mass work will not become effective. Thecorrect and sound direction and the tactics of the mass

==========第11页==========
    movement will also not be ensured
    Mao Zedong once said. no investigation, no right to
    Sdea*. Let us implement and develop our mass work
    according to this standard
    By means of social investigation and class analysis. we
    are able to determine who are ones we must rely uponprincipally and mobilize, who are those we must winover, and who are those we must isolate and make the
    targets of the mass movement. Especially at the basiclevels, it is necessary to have clarification of thesematters. and to have a living identification with theclasses with whom individuals, families and groupsbelong. It is necessary that we learn to distinguish theclasses in real life and not iust in books
    Social investigation and class analysis clarifies theprincipal and secondary matters, the long-term andimmediate problems that the mass movement will face
    Clarifying these matters is part of the orientation of the
    mass movement in a given place, and ensures the correctdirection of the mass movement. In the countryside, forexample. the forms of feudal and semi-feuda

==========第12页==========
    exploitation vary from place to place, and their intensitylikewise, varies from place to place. It is necessary tounderstand this in order to lead the peasant movementeffectively
    In order for our work in propaganda, organization andmass mobilization to be effective and vigorous. their
    content. form and means must suit the conditions of the
    masses. especially their obiective interests and level of
    experience and consciousness. The knowledge of thecondition of the masses can only be derived by means ofsocial investigation and class analysi
    However, a comprehensive and deep-going socialinvestigation cannot be done in on
    a daly. It
    continuous and long-drawn process. Thus, we set thelevel of social investigation according to the level of themass movement and the need to arouse. organize andmobilize the masses at every stage
    For example. there is a depth and breadth of socialinvestigation that is necessary for the stage ofconfiscation and distribution of land of the landlords inthe countryside. There is a big difference between this

==========第13页==========
    and the depth and breadth of social investigation
    necessary to begin mass work in the barrios In the citiesas well, the data necessary for the various levels ofdevelopment of the mass movement vary
    At every stage. it is necessary to accumulate knowledge
    of concrete conditions in order to plan and to carry out
    the immediate tasks of the mass movement, while socia
    investigation continues to widen and deepen
    5. What is the key link
    mass work in the
    countryside?
    The anti-feudal class struggle-meaning to say, agrarianrevolution -is the key link of mass work in thecountryside. We must grasp this firmly, and uphold thepoor peasants, rural workers and lower-middle peasantsas the most basic and sturdiest revolutionary forces in thebarrios
    However, the anti-feudal struggle will not reach far if it
    Is not linked firmly with the anti-fascist andanti-imperialist struggle. Thus, it is necessary to give thebasic anti-feudal forces the most comprehensive political

==========第14页==========
    outlook. Furthermore, we must mobilize actively all thedifferent positive forces in the countryside for therevolution
    The strength of the peasant masses and rural workers willbe formed from the advance of the anti-feudal struggle. Itlays the foundation for winning over the middle forces inthe countryside and for crushing effectively thepolitico-economic power of the landlord class. Thus, theanti-feudal Struggle is decisive in forming democraticpolitical power in the countryside and establishing therevolutionary base
    Wherever there are masses of workers. fisherfolk andindigenous peoples, it is necessary to set up and developtheir organizations whenever there is basis in order toaddress their problems. In any situation, they must bepart of forming the organs of political power and theunited front being built in the countryside
    In order to launch and advance the anti-feudal strugglewe must establish and develop continuously theorganizations of the peasants women, youth and culturalactivists in the barrios. until full-fledged mass

==========第15页==========
    organizations and organs of democratic political power
    emerge
    Mass work and the anti-feudal struggle are linked firmito the armed struggle which is the principal form of
    revolutionary struggle
    The advance of the armed struggle is decisive inadvancing the anti-feudal struggle in an ever-wideningscope and to an ever higher level. Meanwhile, theprincipal objective of mass work and the anti-feudalmovement in the countryside is the formation and the
    strengthening of the mass base foundation of the people
    S war
    The minimum program of agrarian revolution (with
    certain select cases of confiscation and censure or
    punishment of despotic landlords and landgrabbers)iswhat must still be carried out as the general line of theanti-feudal struggle. It contains the lowering of land rent,the elimination of usury, increasing the wages of therural workers, raising the prices of rural productsincreasing agricultural production and other increases inlivelihood. the establishment of simple cooperatives and

==========第16页==========
    cooperative labor. etc
    The premature elevation towards the maximum program(confiscation and free distribution of land)will drive theentire andlord class to unite and concentrate theirstrength against the revolutionary movement. This willfrustrate our anti-feudal line in the united front to takeadvantage of the divisions between the enlightenedgentry and despotic landlords. This requires a higherlevel of capacity, readiness, depth and breadth of themass base and the Party and people s army
    Let us combat the reformism and economism beingpeddled by the opportunist traitors and the organizationsand the bureaucratic 'NGOS they lead in practices such
    as goading the masses into confrontational land
    confiscations. raiding and burning of warehouses and
    other property. rural strikes. so-called macro and microintervention, and claim making, claim taking
    They ride roughshod over the smooth flow of mass workdestroy the unity of the masses and demolish the massorganizations and the Party branches in the areas wherethese projects are launched. Let us oppose actively and

==========第17页==========
    contend ideologically and politically with theseopportunist traitors, revisionists popdems and socdemsand let us not allow them to enter the territories within
    our reach. Let us eject immediately those who haveentered for various reasons and launched these projectswhen their continued operations become a clearobstruction to our mass work
    At present, the mass work in the countryside is linkeddirectly with the recovery, expansion and consolidationof the guerrilla bases and zones, the launching ofsuccessful tactical offensives of the people s army, andthe preparation for the anti-feudal uprising in the
    countryside
    6. What mass movement do we develop in the cities?
    The mass movement that we develop in the cities is thebroad democratic movement which is principallanti-fascist and anti-imperialist. It supports themovement in the countryside which is principallanti-feudal, and supports the armed struggle
    In the cities, the masses of workers and other poor, and

==========第18页==========
    likewise, the petty bourgeoisie (especially the studentsand the teachers) are aroused. organized and mobilizedfor the anti-fascist and anti-imperialist struggles, and in
    order to support the anti-feudal struggle in the
    countryside and the armed struggle
    The proletariat and the semi-proletariat is the most basicand the sturdiest revolutionary forces in the cities
    Therefore we must give them our principal attention
    Organizing and mobilizing them will form thefoundation of the revolutionary strength in the cities. Wemust also win over and mobilize the lower strata of the
    urban petty bourgeoisie. especially the students and the
    eachers and skilled workers, in order to draw the whole
    urban petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie tothe side of the revolution
    In order to launch and advance the mass movement in thecities. it is necessary to form and develop on a wide scalethe unions of the workers and the organizations in thecommunity, schools and others. It is necessary toadvance the struggles of the workers, semi-proletariansstudents and teachers. and other progressive classes and

==========第19页==========
    sectors, step by step, against fascism, imperialismeudalism and bureaucrat capitalism. The workers
    strike movement. which targets the foreign monopocapitalists and the local comprador-big bourgeois, is aprominent feature of the revolutionary mass movementin the cities. We must also strive to form associations andunions among the employees and workers of thegovernment at the national and local levels, institutionsand corporations, in order to shatter and paralyze themfrom within. Likewise, we must give the proper emphasisto the formation of unions of workers and employees inthe factories and enterprises of the national bourgeoisieand the upper petty bourgeoisie, according to the classline of the united front, n this manner. we are able to
    attain the sharpness and breadth of the work and strugglein the cities
    It is necessary to propagate among those in the massmovement in the cities the calll for the anti-feudalstruggle in the countryside and the armed struggle as theprincipal tasks of the whole revolutionary movement
    Growing numbers of revolutionary people in the citiesare being encouraged to participate directly in the

==========第20页==========
    anti-feudal struggle in the countryside and in the armedstruggle, and to extend various forms of support for them
    All of the mass work of the Party must be linkedconsciously to the armed struggle, directly or otherwise
    The revolutionary mass movement in the cities is amilitant and open mass movement which has the
    backbone of an extensive and intensive clandestine
    movement. In this open movement, we employ thereactionary state s own laws in order to relate to thebroad masses. The secret movement is formed among
    them. while the legal organizations are being transformed
    or while new militant but legal organizations are being
    set up, in order to advance the national-democratic linestep by step. We employ a combination of legal and
    Illegal means in order to advance the revolutionarymovement in the cities. The Party is the force at the coreguiding and nurturing the movement at every step, andseeing to it that subsequent steps are taken when
    conditions are ripe
    We must renounce insurrectionism and grasp firmly thecorrect orientation to urban struggle: it is principall

==========第21页==========
    legal and defensive and supportive of the armed struggleand the anti-feudal movement in the countryside. Thesuccess of the movement and struggle in the cities ismeasured by the growing numbers of people whoparticipate in thele mass actions, growing numbers of
    people who join the revolutionary mass organizationsthe worsening political crisis of reaction, and thegrowing support for the movement in the countryside
    The thinking that we can hasten the explosion of anurban uprising through artificial military and agentprovocateur means, and through general paralyzation andgrand confrontations in excess of capabilities, combinedith populist politics and an excessive emphasis ontactical coalitions in an effort to draw in ordinary peopletowards an insurrectionary position, is utterly wrong
    7. Why is mass work important in forming the Party?
    Mass work and the revolutionary mass movement
    establishes the conditions for broadening andstrengthening the Party among the masses
    The biggest source of members of the Party are the most

==========第22页==========
    advanced individuals who are produced and tempered inthe revolutionary mass movement in the cities and thecountryside. The roots of the Party grow deeper andmore extensively while the revolutionary movement
    develops in the factories. barrios. communities and
    schools. The cadres and members of the Party must beconscious in their task to recruit new members and toestablish the basic units of the Party among the ranks ofthee broad masses
    The Party is only an instrument that participates in, butdoes not dominate, the dialectical process of continuousrevolution. It does not stand outside the revolutionaryprocess with a foreknowledge of its laws. The masses arethe sole creators of history, and it is from them that the
    Communist Party must learn. It is only by integratingwith them that the Party can lead the revolution
    The broadening and the strengthening of the Partyorganization among the masses ensures that theirrevolutionary actions will persevere and advance alongthe correct direction. The overall Party leadership of themass movement becomes firmer and sturdier. The line

==========第23页==========
    and policies of the Party are given a more concrete life inthe struggles and actions of the masses. Theconsolidation of the Party results in the expansion andthe advance of the mass movement. and the
    consolidation of the mass movement results in the
    growth and development of the Part
    le Party Is composed of the most advanced elements ofthe class which possesses advanced revolutionary theoryknowledge of the laws of class struggle, and experiencein revolutionary movement. Therefore, it has the capacityto guide all the organizations of the working class andother sectors of the people
    B Propaganda and Education Work
    1. Why is propaganda work important to our masswork 2
    Propaganda work is important because throughpropaganda we are able to reach the broad masses

==========第24页==========
    organized and unorganized-in order to express. clarifand animate the revolutionary analysis, objectives andtasks at every period, stage and place. In this manner, the
    Party is able to unify the thinking, sentiments and actionsof the masses
    Propaganda work is not reserved for a few specialists
    This is conducted by every Party unit and member at
    every opportunity that they are able to mingle with themasses. Conducting propaganda is important in order todraw the Party closer to the masses. and for the masses tobe able to perform well their role in the revolution
    In order for the content of our propaganda to be correctit is necessary for every one to understand the lineprogram and policies of the Party, because these willtuide our analysis of the facts. In order for ourpropaganda to be appropriate, it is necessary to be closeto the masses. We will be able to draw from them theinformation which will provide freshness, scope andrelevance to our anal yses. The content and style ofpropaganda must suit only the present level and tasks ofthe masses with whom we are collaborating

==========第25页==========
    It is only by associating and integrating with the massesthat the units of the Party and army are able to providecomprehensive and timely studies and analyses of theconditions of the masses and the places in which weoperate. It is only in this manner that we are able to giveour propaganda correct content, that our propagandacarries and reflects the conditions. aspirations and idealsof the masses and the people. It is also only in this waythat we are able to ensure that the calls, policies andprogram of action, which we are propagating, are correctand have a firm basis
    Our propaganda work has three interrelated tasks: one, toexpose the enemies of the revolution and to oppose theiranti-people schemes; two, to clarify the line, programpolicies and the means of revolutionary action; and, thlreeto analyze and to illustrate the life and struggle of themasses
    We expose to the masses the root causes of their
    problems, and we show them who their real enemies are
    Based on social investigation, we identify the principalrepresentatives of the basic problems of every class

==========第26页==========
    sector, place and period. We analyze and oppose everyscheme of the enemy to assert its reactionary rule and tosuppress or derail the advance of the revolution. We also
    repudiate
    reformism
    terrorism
    other
    counterrevolutionary ideas and schemes
    It is also the role of propaganda to popularize the calls of
    the Party in order for the masses to understand them,unify around them and carry them out in their ownactions. We expound on the basis of the calls. and we
    also teach the means for carrying them out
    Our propaganda illustrates the life and struggle of themasses in order to heighten their revolutionary qualitiesand to share their experiences in order to form a broad
    and deep unity amongst themselves and to developconfidence in their own strength
    2. What are the means and forms of revolutionary
    propaganda
    The basic means of revolutionary propaganda aredetermined by the mass line and the relationship of thegeneral and particular analyses and calls

==========第27页==========
    From the masses, we gather the concrete, particular andfresh data and events which we analyze and bring back tothe masses in a synthesized form in order to be useful forthe practical struggle. Apart from the information derivedfrom social investigation. it is also important to derivedata from research and readings
    Propaganda relates the general objectives tasks anddirection with the particular objectives, tasks and means
    The general line and calls may be the emphasis, but theseare particularized according to the masses with whom weare addressing. The particular analysis and calls may bethe emphasis, but these are related to the general line and
    tasks
    It is necessary to attend to both secret and openpropaganda work In clandestine propaganda, we are ableto conduct the broadest and deepest discussion andexpress the most advanced calls. According to whatconditions allow, we give this an open form. In openpropaganda, it is necessary to become creative in strivingto balance the legal limitations with our task to reach thebiggest number of people with the revolutionary line

==========第28页==========
    There are many forms of propaganda which may beutilized and developed. Mass publications, handbillsmass meetings, group discussions, slogan paintingposters, comics, house meetings, play, song and poetryproductions, dance, broadcast, video and films and manyothers are commonplace. We must also create and utilize
    spaces within the mass media controlled by the enemysuch as newspapers. magazines. radio and television
    stations
    In addition to being correct and appropriate, ourpropaganda must also be effective. Effective propagandais live, clear and sharp, because it is rooted in the actualife of the masses and uses their language. The
    combination of various forms also gives an exceeding
    effectiveness, so does the regular, frequent and rapidaddressing of issues which crop up in the course of mass
    work
    All revolutionaries must use every opportunity toconduct propaganda among the masses in order to clarifythe objectives, plans, policies and the tasks of therevolution and the masses. We must not allow any

==========第29页==========
    revolutionary to be separated from the masses. Every onemust participate in the practical movement, organize themasses. lead their struggle. participate in production. andtake part in the joys and sorrows of the masses. Not tocarry this out is a form of liberalism
    3. Why is education work important to our mass work?
    Basically, the objective of propaganda and educationwork is the same: raise the level of revolutionary
    consciousness of the masses in order for them to
    participate actlve
    and wholeheartedly in the
    revolutionary movement
    Education is the formal. concentrated and systematictudy of the revolution by the organized masses
    Education work places theirparticipation in
    e
    revolutionary struggle on a sturdy theoretical foundation
    Education also develops the capacity and skill of themasses in order for them to carry out their revolutionarywork and tasks more effectively
    Providing education cannot be separated from theestablishment and consolidation of mass organizations. If

==========第30页==========
    the masses are able to study systematically and regular
    the ideological and political outlook takes root amongthem which will guide their every action and theirlong-term development in the revolution. Their capaciand skill to carry out and complete more numerous andmore complex revolutionary work will continue todevelop and broaden
    It is also necessary to propagate among the masses theresults of the summing-up of the work of therevolutionary movement, especially the positive andnegative lessons, strengths and weaknesses, successesand setbacks. The masses must conduct a detaied studof the lessons from their own revolutionary experience inorder to persevere along the correct path, and to correctthe errors as a result of the Left and Right opportunistlines. This will serve as a guide and a firm footing for the
    further strengthening and development of the
    revolutionary mass movement. The content of masseducation is comprehended better by the masses when itis linked to their own revolutionary experience
    4. What are the types of mass education that we

==========第31页==========
    provde
    The principal types of mass education that we provideare the study of the special courses and the study of the
    general course
    The special mass courses clarify the history, characterand revolutionary solution to the principal problems ofthe particular classes or sectors that we organize andmobilize
    The special mass course for the peasant movementdiscusses the problem of feudalism and the agrarianrevolution. The special mass course for the workersmovement discusses the union movement and the strike
    movement. The special mass course for the women Smovement discusses their problems and their liberation
    And the special mass course for the youth movementdiscusses the problems of youth and the correctorientation of their movement. Other special masscourses may also be outlined based on need, for examplefor the fisherfolk movement or for the middle forces
    On the other hand. the general mass course studies the

==========第32页==========
    history of the Philippines. the three basic problems of thecountry at the present time, and the basic principles and
    task of the people s national-democratic revolution
    After the special and general mass courses, it isnecessary for the masses to begin immediately the studof Marxist-leninist principles. For example, we maydiscuss the basic attitude of a proletarian revolutionary inrelation to serving the people, to criticism andself-criticism. to tasks and sacrifice. the basic principles
    of democratic centralism, collective leadership and massline: social investigation and class analysis: and certainprinciples of dialectical and historical materialism
    le mass courses, and especially the introductory stuof Marxism-leninism, prepares the advanced individualto become candidate-members of the Party
    Together with this, the masses are given education indeveloping their capacity and skill in leading massorganizations, propaganda work, developing productionhealth and medicine, culture, literacy, livelihoodsupplements, introductory defense training and security
    and others

==========第33页==========
    It is important for our mass education work to have a
    program for systematically developing the consciousnessand capacity of the masses, mass activists and thosetargeted for recruitment as members of the Party. Wemust make sure we allot some time for carrying out these
    education plans. This is one essential revolutionary workand task which we must not neglect
    C. Organizing the Masses
    What are the two most important principles we mustremember in organizing the masses?
    The first is to base oneself and to trust the masses. This isthe basic principle, the mass line, that clarifies the correctstyle in organizing the masses
    It is necessary to allow the masses to learn to take actionsbased on their own initiative and willingness to assumetasks. What the cadres of the Party must do is guide themasses and not to assume all the work. It is necessary tobase oneself and to trust the masses in order to allow for

    the emergence of the greatest number of people ready forvarious tasks of the revolution. We must alwaysremember that when the masses understand and embracethe objectives of the revolution and the formation of theirown strength. they will become creative and persistent in
    their own actions, and leaders and activists will emerefrom their own ranks. Let us not presume that only a fewpeople can lead. Let us combat commandism and tailismin organizing the masses
    The second principle is the solid organization of themasses for revolutionary struggle. What this means is theestablishment of broad, sturdy and closely knitorganizations with a leadership that is unified andhealthy and rooted in the mass membership
    It is not enough to have only influence among the massesin order to advance the revolution steadily. It is necessaryto organize the masses solidly in order to unify themsturdily and prepare them for all-rounded struggleagainst their class enemies. If the masses are notorganized solidly, their struggle will advance only up to alimited extent, and they will persist only in certain

==========第35页==========
    conditions. Our obiective is for the masses to become asturdy bastion of the revolution
    The leadership of the mass organizations must becomposed of the most reliable, most vibrant, and mostrespected leaders, meaning to say, those who hail fromthe basic classes and strata who have an excellent record
    of humanity, who can be trusted and who have a genuineconcern for fellow human beings. It is necessary to unifthem through collective study of the correct line andpolicies, and to educate them in collective leadership ofthe mass organizations. The leadership will alwaysremain healthy as long as erstwhile leaders who do notdevelop, are backward or are rotten, are replaced by fresh,progressive individuals from the membership. Thisleadership must be linked firmly with the massmembership, must consult them on important problemsand decision-making, and must rely on the unified willand action of the membership principally to carry out itstasks. Solid organizations can be formed only in the
    midst Of mass struggles
    2. What are the preliminary steps in organizing the

==========第36页==========
    masses
    The first step in organizing the masses in the barriosfactories, communities. schools or offices, is to locate
    reliable contacts
    Preliminary contacts may be products of mass work inother places, relatives. our friends or acquaintances. orthose of other comrades, or those of the family of a
    comrade
    Preliminary contacts may be formed into coordinatinggroups in order to carry out tasks collectively
    As much as possible. the preliminary contacts must hail
    from the class or sector to which we are giving principalstress. They must be honest. have an excellent record ofhumanity, know a lot of people, and [be] enthusiastic incarrying out tasks. When in a barrio, Strive to findcontacts from the exploited peasants or rural workers. Ifthere are none, the preliminary contacts may also hailfrom the middle forces. But at the earliest opportunitywe must allow those contacts who hail from the basicclasses to emerge. Before we give them work, it is

==========第37页==========
    necessary to conduct a detailed investigation of thepreliminary contacts, especially those who do not hailfrom the basic forces of the revolution
    It is the task of the preliminary contacts to link us upwith other individuals from the class or sector that wewould like to mobilize. They can assist in the preliminarysocial investigation, class analysis and preliminarypropaganda among the masses. It is also their task toprovide us with information on the movements of theenemy as well as the unreliable elements in the area. Inthe countryside, it is also their task to safeguard thesecurity of comrades while inside as well as whileleaving the barrio
    We must not divulge to the preliminary contacts theoverall plan for the area and the progress of the massorganizing. Although some or all of them may becomepart of organizations that will be formed in thesucceeding stage. it is not yet certain and will still bebased on their future actions
    3. Why must we establish organizing groups andorganizing committees 2 When do we form them?

==========第38页==========
    We must establish the organizing groups and organizingcommittees step by step in order to select and train themass leaders, to form the backbone and foundation of themass organizations. and to launch the actions andstruggles that the masses are capable of doing
    We set up the groups and committees in the variousclasses and sectors that we want to organize. In thebarrios, we form the organizing groups and organizingcommittees of the peasants, women, youth, culturalactivists, and wherever there is a basis. fisherfolk and
    workers In the cities, we form the organizing groups andorganizing committees of the workers in the factories. ofthe community in the urban poor communitiesorganizing groups and organizing committees in the
    schools
    We form the organizing groups based on division of theclass and sector. and division of the various parts of the
    territory. In the countryside, we form the organizinggroups of the various classes and sectors in the sitios andvarious parts of the barrio. In the factory, we form themin every department or section; in the communities, in

==========第39页==========
    every street or important segment: and in the schools. inevery college or important part of it
    In organizing the masses, we must follow therevolutionary class line strictly. In a typical farmingbarrio, those who may join the organizing group of thepeasants must hail from the ranks of poor peasants ruralworkers, and the lower-middle peasants. In a fishingbarrio, those who may join the organizing group musthail from the ranks of poor and middle fisherfolk, fishingworkers, and from the ranks of the exploited peasantsand rural workers, if there are any. In setting up theorganizing groups of the youth in the countryside, wemay allow those who hail from the upper strata of thepeasantry, but the emphasis remains on those who hailfrom the ranks of the exploited peasant youth. In thecommunities of the urban poor, we must rely principallyon the workers and semi-proletarians and secondarily onthe youth-students In the schools, the organizing groupsmust be formed by the students. teachers and lower-levelschool employees
    The organizing groups begin to set up the organized

==========第40页==========
    strength of the people in the most important parts of theplace that we are organizing. They link us up with thebroad masses. They propagate among the masses theobjectives of the revolutionary movement throughpropaganda and study. They lead the preliminary actionsof the masses. Their principal task is to arouse and unify
    the oppressed and exploited classes. to recruit new
    members. and to begin the transformation of the legal
    organizations or the formation of new organizations
    within their scope
    We form the organizing committees in the sectors whichlready have standing organizing groups in the variousimportant parts of a given scope, and where advancedindividuals capable of leading mass organizations havelready emerged
    In the factories, communities and schools in the cities
    we may first form the organizing committee andsubsequently form the organizing groups, if we are ableo gather the mass activists who have proven themselves
    to be reliable in other places
    The organizing committees will lead the organizing

==========第41页==========
    groups, mobilize them on the basis of set tasks, and willcontinue to develop them. Under the leadership of thecommittee, the work of deepening the socialinvestigation will continue: the transformation of openorganizations or the setting up of new ones will go on; Sowill the invigoration of mass actions and struggles: and
    so will the study of the political line and
    Marxist-leninist principles
    In the countryside, the organizing committees will formthe committees for organization, education, economyhealth and defense. In the beginning, the committees andorganizing groups of peasants will mobilize as leagues ofpoor peasants, rural workers and lower-middle peasants
    Once they have developed, advanced individuals fromthe other levels of middle peasants will slowly bebrought into the organizing groups. The principal basisfor accepting them is their support for the anti-feudal
    struggle
    The committees and organizing groups are secretorganizations. They must excel in clandestine tactics and
    means of mobilization while leading and participating in

==========第42页==========
    the open organizations and mass mobilizations
    4. How do the full-fledged mass organizations,revolutionary committees, and units of the peoplemilitia emerge in the barrio
    Full-fledged mass organizations are set up in the barrio ifthere are already strong and sturdy committees andorganizing groups; if the influence and leadership of thecommittees and organizing groups is already widespreadand rooted among the masses; and if there are already
    proven leaders who are capable of leading, and who arereliable. and who have a sufficient grasp of the line andpolicies of the Party and revolution, especiallly withregards the anti-feudal struggle and the armed struggle
    The full-fledged mass organization will be formed
    means of listing the members and the election of its
    leadership. When conditions demand it, we may digressfrom this procedure as long as we can assure theparticipation and approval of the masses in the formationof the organization and its leadership. Once thefull-fledged mass organizations of the revolutionaryclasses and sectors are formed, and there are alread

==========第43页==========
    Party branches that are capable of leading therevolutionary movement in the barrio, and there arelready local units of the New People s Army (NPAthat cover the scope of the locality and local peoplesmilitia. we may now form the revolutionary committee
    This will stand as the local organ of democratic politicalpower under the leadership of the Party. This will beormed by gathering representatives of the Party, thebasic masses, the people s army and allies
    Even at the level of the barrio organizing committee. wemust already begin to provide politico-military trainingto men and women who are ready and are capable ofconducting military work, and to form units of the peoplemilitia. In every typical sitio or barrio center, we mayform a squad or a half-squad of the people' s militiaarmed with indigenous weapons or weapons provided fortheir disposition
    It is the task of the people s militia to lead in providingrevolutionary peace and order, and In providing securithe revolutionary forces in the barrio. It also carriesout tasks assigned to it by the Party or by a higher

Although they have military tasksmembers of the people s militia still attend to theirday-to-day livelihood duties. They comprise the core ofthe armed strength of the people in the barrio. together
    ith th[e defense groups of mass organlzations
    As enforcers of revolutionary laws and iustice. the NPA
    the people s militia, and the defense units, must studythe basic democratic rights of the people and individualsand they must understand the correct principles andmethods in carrying out their appropriate tasks in civiland criminal cases
    5. How are the basic units of the Party formed amongthe ma sses
    Even at the level of the organizing groups and organizingcommittees, we must already begin to provide
    Marxist-leninist education to the advanced individuals
    We can already tell who are enthusiastic in accepting theideological line of the Party. We continue to analyze theactions and participation of the active individuals and

==========第45页==========
    whoever else displays honesty. enthusiasm and skill inorganizing. We ensure that the mass activists are givensystematic political education in preparation for theirstudy of the basic Party course. After a certain period oftime has lapsed, based on their record of actions andparticipation in study, we can recruit the most advanced
    Ig them and set up a basic unit of the Party
    At the basic level. Party branches will be formed. and
    likewise, Party groups in the mass organizations. Thebranches and groups ensure the Party"s leadership of themass movement, and welds the sturdiest link between the
    Party and the masses. The Party branches and groupscontinue to temper and strengthen themselves bycontinuing the study of the line and policies of the Party
    )y leading the mass movement, and by recruiting newmembers. In the factories. we dissolve the organizinggroups and organizing committees once we have set upthe Party branches and Party groups inside the union andimportant parts of the enterprise. and all of the activistshave already entered the union
    We also dissolve thele organizing groups and organizing

==========第46页==========
    committees of the community and the school in the citiesonce we have set up the Party branch and the Partygroups in the mass organizations and other importantparts of a given scope. In large schools, Partyorganizations may be developed until the sectioncommittee and the branches in the colleges are formed
    In developing the work in the communities, Partbranches may be formed based on street blocks
    6. How do mass activists emerge?
    Mass activists are individuals among the ranks of themasses who are active in revolutionary work and inadvancing the mass movement. Numerous mass activistswill emerge if the masses with whom we link andmobilize are encouraged to take initiative. are assisted in
    raising their political consciousness. are given concrete
    guidance, are aided in summing up their own experience
    and are Supported In resolving their personal problems
    An important objective of mass work is the emergenceand training of numerous activists in the countryside andin the cities. In order to carry out the numerous andheavy tasks of the revolution, we need to learn how to

==========第47页==========
    combine a Tew experienced cadres with numerous assactivists. This is a concrete expression of trusting and
    basing ourselves among the masses. Even at the stage of
    preliminary contacts and forming coordinating groupsthe emergence and training of mass activists alreadybegins. Even at this stage. we already select those whohave initiative. have a good record of humanity. relatewell with others. are responsible, are disciplined andhave dedication. We train and provide them withpreliminary studies in order for them to carry out thetasks they face. We continue to raise their capacity bcontinuously providing studies, by assessing andsumming up their work, and by helping them in theirproblems with the work, in their studies or personalproblems. We test them in more important undertakingsand we elevate their tasks and responsibilities in the
    work or organization
    As our mass work and revolutionary activities developand become more complex. the need for more leaders,mass activists who can manage different lines of work
    becomes more important. We need a program for theemergence of mass activists that can ensure that there

==========第48页==========
    will always be those who can attend continuously to thedifferent lines of work. This program includes the criteriafor selection. education and training programs. andassistance in work problems as well as personal problems
    We must ensure that the mass activists have sufficient
    skill and readiness, because it is not enough to have ongood intentions in the practical movement
    7. Why is the combination of legal and illegal forms oforganization necessar
    In the countryside or in the cities, the illegal Party andthe secret or illegal mass organizations form the
    backbone of the mass movement. This is where we find
    in concentration-and where we can develop to the hilt
    -the most active. the most basic leaders and individualsof the mass movement. The illegal Party is the leadingforce at the core. guiding the advance
    the
    revolutionary mass movement step by step. Without abroad and sturdy secret movement. the mass movementwill not be able to persevere in the correct directionespecially in the face of enemy attack or difficult
    In the countryside, even though the illegal organizations

==========第49页==========
    can lead the broad masses directly, it is still necessary toform the open and legal organizations. Because
    clandestine organizations are organizations which must
    be secret in the eyes of the enemy and people who cannotbe trusted. it is also necessary to have open organizations
    The open organizations serve as the channel of our legalmobilizations. a shelter for our secret organizations. ameans for reaching and linking up with other classes andsectors we can draw closer. and a tool for the masses totake advantage of all the possibilities in order to advancetheir own revolutionary actions In forming the open andlegal mass organizations in the countryside. we mustalways bear in mind linking its actions with the tasks ofthe armed struggle and the agrarian revolution. At alltimes. the legal organizations must not be the channel forthe illegal anti-feudal demands. We must be on guardagainst allowing the illegal and the secret to drag in the
    ega
    In the cities, the need to set up open and legal massorganizations is more acute. These open and legal
    formations serve as the channel to reach, mobilize andfor the Party to lead the broad masses in the cities

==========第50页==========
    D. Mobillizing the Masses
    1. What are mass actions and mass campaign.s
    A mass action is any planned collective mobilization ofthe masses for a definite objective. The most importantmass action is the mass struggle or the planned collectiveconfrontation of the masses against their enemies
    Examples of such actions and mass struggles are workers
    strikes, confrontations of peasant masses against theirlandlords to lower the land rent, the organized support ofthe masses for the military operations of the peoplesarmy. collective protests against their abusers. collectivework in the field and others
    Mass campaigns are planned, organized and perseveringseries of mass actions of a broad scope in order to
    achieve a set objective. There are different types of masscampaigns according to obiective: there are masspolitical campaigns, military, organizational, education,economy and health campaigns

==========第51页==========
    Whatever mass campaign is launched, we need to ensurethat its content and direction is in accordance with theline and orientation clarified in the first part of this stud
    on mass work
    In the countryside. what we must launch first and
    foremost are the mass campaigns which have an
    anti-feudal character and which advance the armed
    struggle. In the cities what we must launch first andforemost are the mass campaigns which assert thedemocratic rights of the basic masses against fascism andbureaucrat capitalism, which advance the struggle of theworking class against foreign imperialists andcomprador- big bourgeois. and which support theanti-feudal movement in the countryside and the armed
    struggle.
    There are mass campaigns which have a character of
    struggle for reforms. We recognize the importance ofthese mass campaigns in forming the unity of the masses
    However. these campaigns must be launched in such away as to highlight the revolutionary initiative of themasses. and to draw them closer to supporting and

==========第52页==========
    participating in the revolutionary armed struggle
    Likewise. it is important to mobilize the masses in
    contributing their different technical and material skillsto the revolution. such as logistics and finance. technicalknow-how in livelihood, culture, personal skilcommunications and transportation. health and other
    facilities
    Mass mobilizations
    the actions. struggles and
    campaigns that the masses participate in-are important
    In reality, the advance of the revolutionary massmovement is centered on the mobilization. Efforts toarouse and organize the masses have the obiective of
    preparingthem to aunch and advance the massmobilizations. By having the masses participate in theseactions, we develop them and they are able to achieve thefollowing:
    a. they are given political experience and theirpolitical consciousness
    raised
    confrontations with their enemies
    b. their unity is tempered. and confidence in their

==========第53页==========
    own strength and ability to resolve problemsdevelops: and
    c they achieve concrete development in their
    political, economic and cultural conditions
    2. What must be done before launching mass actions
    ana mass campaign.
    a. Investigate well the problem that we wouldlike to address or solve. Understand its nuancesand the forces involved, and in relation to thisbe clear about its objectives, draw up aconcrete plan, set the appropriate means of
    mobilization and struggle, and prepare theorganization. Ensure that the three principlesguiding our actions are followed: One, there isa just basis; two, we have the upperhandand three, act with self-restraint
    b. Ensure that there is sufficient preparation forthe participation of the greatest number. Themasses must understand and agree with theneed of the planned action or struggle. In order

==========第54页==========
    for any action or struggle to be successful, thethinking of the masses must be prepared andtheir determination formed
    Prepare the organization of the masses. It isdifficult to succeed if this is loose or weak
    Whether the plan is successful or suffers asetback. the organization of the masses must be
    prepared to persevere in unity and collective
    action. Prepare for retaliation Irom the enemy
    d Form and prepare the group that leads and setsthe pace. This group takes the lead inconducting propaganda among the massesabout the obiectives and the means of
    mobilization or struggle. They take the lead inunifying the masses and preparing them andgetting support from the middle forces. Theyobserve the actual course of the mobilization or
    struggle and take the necessary steps in orderto resolve the problems that arise. They willlead the advance of the mobilization until it issuccessfull, or they will lead the organized

==========第55页==========
    retreat if unsuccessful
    3. What are the tasks after every mass action and massstruggle?
    After any mass action or mass struggle, whether it issuccessful or a failure, whether the results are positive ornegative. it is necessary to sum up experiences together
    with the masses-analyze the experiences of the massesand draw lessons from them for the Party-andafterwards, propagate the summed-up experiences among
    the masses. In this manner. the meaning of their
    experience becomes clear to the Party and the masses
    They are able to grasp its lessons, to raise their politicalconsciousness, and to develop their capacity to advancethe revolutionary movement
    The mass leaders are tested in these mass actions andmass struggles, and those who are enthusiastic andadvanced among the masses emerge. After the mass
    actions and mass struggles, we must help those inleadership to sum up their experience and analyze theirperformance of the tasks. We must also pay attention tothe newly-emergent forces who are enthusiastic and

==========第56页==========
    advanced in carrying out the actions. We must encouragethem to take further initiative and to participate more inthe work. If necessary, those in leadership who haveproven to be unreliable or not capable must be replacedby those who are more developed
    4. Why do we need a combination of legal and illegalforms of mobilization and struggle
    In the countryside and in the cities. the effectivecombination of legal and illegal forms of mobilizationand mass struggles is necessary. The revolutionary massmovement is able to advance most rapidly, mostvigorously and most comprehensively in utilizing allorms appropriate to the conditions
    In the present strategic defensive stage of the people swar, when the revolutionary forces are gathering strengthstep by step, the people s army is not yet big and strong
    The fighting fronts are only small guerrilla bases andzones that the big and strong enemy forces can stillventure into. Thus, while we advance the armed form of
    our struggle, it is necessary to invigorate the open andlegal forms of mobilization and struggle, in order to

==========第57页==========
    advance the revolutionary mass movement in the mostrapid way
    In the cities, the principal form of struggle is open andlegal in recognition of the concentration and strength ofthe enemy here. In order to advance the revolutionarymass movement in the cities. it is necessary to advancethe open and militant mass struggles
    Legal mobilizations and struggles must serve the illegalstruggle. Meaning to say, they must be in accordancewith and serve the central task to seize political powerand in particular, serve the advance of the armedstruggle.
    On the other side of our correct and successful use of acombination of armed and legal forms of struggle, therewere also deviations and a disorientation brought about
    )y Left and Right opportunist lines, which resulted in
    damage and setbacks
    The armed and legal or unarmed forms of struggle areboth forms of political struggle. It is often said correctlthat war is a continuation of politics by other means. The

==========第58页==========
    New People s Army and the people s war have arevolutionary political character, and are the politicalweapons of the people
    Relative to armed struggle, the legal forms of struggleare secondary because, by themselves or if consideredprincipal, they are unable to seize the political power forthe proletariat and the people. The social revolutionnecessitates the total victory of the armed struggle
    However, the legal forms of struggle are important andare indispensable for the advance of the armed revolution
    Each form has its unique characteristics, and each has itsrole to play. Legal forms are defensive in the face of theoverwhelmingly large police and military forces of theenemy, but are intended to win over the largest numberof the people to fight the enemy
    The Party needs to coordinate the armed and the
    unarmed. the legal and the illegal. the secret and the openforces and forms of struggle in the cities and thecountryside. The advance of all forces and forms ofstruggle must become the product of this coordination
    We must repudiate the Right opportunist lie that the

==========第59页==========
    Party neglected the legal struggle by launching therevolutionary armed struggle. The Right opportunistswould like the Party to put a stop or tone down theemphasis on the principal form of revolutionary struggle
    The truth is the Party continues to stand as the leadingforce in the legal democratic movement. In order to make
    theeeral democratic movement in the cities more
    g
    effective. the Party needs to lessen the proportion of
    cadres confined to offices. institutions and coalitions and
    to assign and develop more cadres in the factories, urbanpoor communities, and schools. Instead of stopping orlessening the emphasis on armed struggle, the Partyneeds to correct the reverse fow of cadres from the
    countryside to the cities and to start sending more cadres
    and mass activists to the countryside
    Legal struggles have already assumed concrete forms
    The most important of these are the mass educationefforts. mass organizing and mass mobilizations whichare always carried out in accordance with thenational-democratic program. These can be gleaneddramatically in the strikes, demonstrations, marches andother forms of coordinated mass actions of the class

==========第60页==========
    sectoral and multisectoral issues
    The preliminary peace talks between the Ramos regimeand the NDFP is yet another form of legal struggle
    Through these negotiations, an illegal force such as theNDFP is allowed to propagate through legal means itsnational-democratic line as a line for a iust and lastingpeace and to attain international recognition of its statusof belligerency. However, we must be alert to the dangerof sending the wrong signal to the revolutionary forcesthat the enemy is easy to talk to. and of creating illusionsamong the people. The revolutionary forces must alwaysbe ready to break off from preliminary or bilateral peacetalks when they serve only to weaken instead ofstrengthening the revolutionary forces
    The progressive organizations must give highest priorityto their own political education, to strengthen
    eir
    organization and to the mass campaigns. They maypropagate the national-democratic line in any legal field
    However, this program must not be exclusive orprincipally devoted to any bourgeois electoral contestinfluencing any institution or branch of the reactionary

==========第61页==========
    government:, or even the framework of the peacenegotiations between the NDPP and the reactionarygovernment; or even all of these. All revolutionarcadres in the legal democratic movement must grasp thecorrect relation and coordination between the armed and
    legal forms of struggle, as well as between the variousforms of legal struggle
    The Right opportunists exaggerate the importance of alllegal forms of struggle, or else, they select one of themand blow up their importance and place the legal struggleon a higher plane than armed struggle. One way ofdistinguishing revolutionaries from reformists is howthey regard the importance of armed struggle and howthey correlate the armed and legatal forms of struggle
    Reformism is exposed whenever it denies the necessityof armed revolution in the Philippines today. On theother hand, left"opportunism denies the necessity andimportance of the legal democratic movement, aneconfines itself to armed struggle until it reaches the pointwhere it can no longer see the correct relation andcoordination of armed struggle and the legal democratic

==========第62页==========
    movement
    Those who do not recognize or understand the bimportance of the organs of political power and massorganizations established in the countryside in the course
    of the people "s war may feel disillusioned by theprotractedness of the armed revolution. These peopleusually exhibit the petty-bourgeois thinking that thesuccess of the armed revolution can be measured only byhow much political power we have already attained inthe cities. Of course, the final part of the armedrevolution is the seizure of the cities. However. we mightbe drawn farther away from attaining this obiective if weare to wallow in Left opportunism or if we are to allow
    Right opportunism to obstruct the armed revolution
    E. Consolidation and Expansion
    1. What is meant by consolidation?
    Consolidation means the mobilization and the
    development of the consciousness and organization of

==========第63页==========
    the masses at each stage
    In the countryside. this means the formation of theguerrilla bases and zones; the establishment of basicmass organizations and organs of political power; theformation of units of the Party and the NPA; thelaunching of anti-feudal mass campaigns; the conveningof mass education courses, etc
    In the cities, consolidation means advancing thedemocratic movement of the workers. other urban poorand lower levels of the petty bourgeoisie (especially thestudents and teachers)in the factories, communities andschools: the formation of unions of workers and mass
    organizations in the communities and schools; theestablishment of Party branches and groups; theformation of alliances based on the principles of united
    front: the formation of secret mass organizations: and the
    convening of mass education courses. etc
    The ongoing mass education campaigns are an importanttoo of consolidation in order to raise the evel ofconsciousness, capacity and experience of the masses
    These education campaigns always prepare them to face

==========第64页==========
    new problems which are a result of the heightened levelof struggle or a retreat from the previous level
    2. What is meant by expansion?
    Expansion means adding more places or groups to the
    scope of mass work. It means opening up new placessectors and groups that we are able to reach and mobilize
    In the countryside, we open up barrios and localities andwe begin mass work in them. In the cities. we increasethe factories, communities and schools that we are ableto reach and we begin mass work in them
    First and foremost, we expand by means of formingcoordinating groups and organizing groups of the peoplein the places where we are starting mass work
    3. What is the relation of consolidation and
    expansion
    We conduct expansion based on consolidation. and we
    consolidate while conducting expansion. Expansion with
    consolidation is the effective way of rooting therevolutionary movement on a wide scale. Even thoughwe are already mobilizing in new places. we must ensure

==========第65页==========
    the continuous development ofprevious areas ofmobilization
    On the other hand, we must be on guard as well of thedanger of being dragged into consolidation to the neglectof expansion. We would like the revolutionar
    movement to spread out on the broadest scope possible
    It is wrong to be satisfied with a narrow place
    In the countryside, the units of the people s army needsufficient expanse, depth and sturdiness in order tomaneuver. In the cities. it is necessary to reach the broad
    masses and people continuously in order to make them
    participate in the political struggle, principally theanti-fascist and anti-imperialist struggle. It is necessaryto cast the net of the secret movement on the widest scale
    pPOssie
    In order to combine consolidation and expansioncorrectly, it is necessary to plan all of the work, takinginto account the needs, targets and capabilities. At everyperiod, we must determine which of the two we mustgive principal attention to, without neglecting the other

==========第66页==========
    The basic principle we must bear in mind is, expandbased on consolidation. and consolidate while
    expanding
    Our overall guide to expansion work and consolidation isthe wave upon wave advance according to the present
    line of waging extensive and intensive guerrilla warfare
    based on an ever widening and ever deepening massbase
    We must rectify and combat the "Left opportunist lineof military adventurism and urban insurrectionism whichtook away units directed at the expansion work andconsolidation of the mass base and the guerrilla zones
    Likewise, we must also rectify and combat the Rightopportunist line of capitulationism, parliamentarism andreformism which surrenders to the enemy the proletarianclass leadership of the people s national-democraticrevolution
    Rectification must continue to reinvigorate and tosharpen the quality of mass work and the formation ofthe mass base in the countryside. There is an immediate
    big need to expand the guerrilla fronts and to recover lost

==========第67页==========
    territories, together with immediately facing theproblems of consolidation which are now relegated to thesecondary position. What is needed is grasping andcarrying out solid organizing; and the correct balance ofexpansion and consolidation, the anti-feudal class lineongoing education and propaganda work, and advancingvarious types of mass campaigns
    We must take advantage of the enemys loosening upover a large part of the countryside in order toconcentrate the bullk of its forces and resources inattacking a few priority targets. We must learn to adjustand persevere and develop our mass work even insituations and scopes where jostling with the enemy ismore intense. We must not abandon or just neglect
    populated areas, those along transportationcommunications and supply lines, and those important tothe links and support of the movement in the cities, justbecause of enemy surveillance. We must learn to excel incombining according to the changing military situationand the particularities of the places (secluded andmountainous, lower elevation and plain, or along thetown and highway); of organization and secret and open
