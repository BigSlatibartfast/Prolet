It is not possible to rule the 450million people of this country by following a policy of repression. It is not possible for any imperialist country to take such a big responsibilityAmerican imperialism is writing in death pangsin keeping its commitment to those countriesof the world which it has assured of giving aid
    Meanwhile, an industrial crisis has developed in
    America. It can be seen from President Johnson'sutterance itself that the number ofunemploved isincreasing in the country. According to the off

    unemployed; 35 million people are semi-unemployed and In factorles also Seml-unemployment is continuing. So the Indian Governmentwill fail to suppress the ever-increasing discontent of the people. This attack on democracywill inevitably transtorm the peoples discontentinto struggles. Some indication of the shape ofthe protest movement of tomorrow is availablerom the language movement of Madras. So, thecoming era is not merely an era of big strugglesbut also an era of bigvictoriesThee Communist

    But we, the true Marxists, know that carrying outthe Party's political responsibility means that thefinal aim of all propaganda, all movements andall organizations of the Party is to establish firmthe political power of the proletariat. It shouldbe remembered always that if the words Seizureof Political Power are left out, the Party no longer remains a revolutionary party. Although itwill remain a revolutionary party in name thenit will be actually reduced to a reformist party ofthe bourgeoisie
    When speaking of seizure ofpolitical power,some mean the Center. They think that with thegradual expansion oof the limits of the movementour only aim will be to capture power centrally.

Inhe era of socialism. all the elements of area-wideseizure of power are present in our framework

    Comrades. the above-mentioned incidentsdemand from us some analysis
    Firstly, what was thee historica reason as aresult of which this massive form of that movement in those days coudcreate Intense hatre
    against the class enem
    Secondly, what again were the causes thatturned that vast movement into a failure?
    First, it was the slogan of seizure of politcal power that created the massive form of thatmovement of those days, created the intensehatred against the class enemy.On the oppositeside, it was this slogan that made the class enemyadopt his class role. It is the expression of this thatwe find in the barbaric rape of the young peasantwoman and the beastly violent attack to smashhe movement. On the other hand the peasantsalso did not hesitate to attack the class enemy
    This raises the question: Why couldnt powerbe seized even after this? It couldnt be seizedfor one reason only-it was because the fighting people of theose days looked to the center forarms; we then lost faith in the path indicated by
    Lenin. We hesitated in those days to accept thatbold declaration of Lenin to carry forward therevolution by collecting arms locally and seizingpower area-wide. As a result, the unarmed peas
    ants could not stand up and resist in the face o
    arms. Even those who fought defying death had

    e lesson that has to be

    Dao, knives, sticks-all these are weapons, andith their help at opportune moments, firearmswill have to be snatched. The events describedabove are manifestations of revisionist thinkingin its theoretical aspect. Now, from the organizational point of view, those mistakes will haveto be found out which were hurdles in the wayof a correct leadership of the vast movementsof those days, so that they may not find a nestfresh in the revolutionary Party. To smash all
    ose mistakes inthe Party, the Party will today
    first have to establish its leadership over the massorganizations. For, a review of the history of the
    Party over a long period would reveal that as aresult of the revisionist thiIn king of regardingeaders of trade unions andPeasant organlzatlonskrishak sabha)as the real representatives of thepeople, the Party was reduced to a party of a fewindividuals. Because of this thinking, the partypolitical activities became inert, and the proletar

    importance of this organization, another type oflocalism is born. Comrades think that the Partwill suffer a serious loss if any comrade 1s shifte
    from his area and they take this as a loss to personal leadership. From thiS ocalism anothertype of opportunism develops. Comrades think
    at their area 1s the most revolutionary, natu

Naturalllhe question arises-what are the methods thathelp to get out of these deviations? What arehose Marxist directives which become essentialtasks for building up a revolutionary party?
    Firstly, all works of organization of the future
    nave to be done as complementary to the
    Party. In other words, the mass organizations will
    ave to be used as a part of serving one main

    Secondly, immediately from now the entire
    effort oof the Party will have to bee spent onrecruiting newer and newer cadres and on forming countless Activist Groups consisting ofthem. It should be remembered that in the coming era of struggles, the masses will have to beeducated through the illegal machinery. So everyparty member from now on will have to be madehabituated to illegal work. To get used to illegal work, it is an essential task for every Activist
    Group to paste illegal posters. It is only thirougthis process that they will
    e able to act as the
    bold core in leading struggles in the era of strugdes. Otherwise, the revolution will be reducedto a petty bourgeois idle dream
    Thirdly, it is through these active organiza
    tionsthat the Party will be able to establish its
    leadership over the mass organizations. So fromnow on we shall have to help the members of the

    We saw the expression of this in the sponta-neous democratic revolution of 1949 whichwas dimmed byus In trying to confine it withinthe narrow bounds of socialist revolution.

Above all,later on, it was as a consequence to the denialof this Chinese Revolution that the slogan wasraised within the Party that the revolution will beachieved not througth the Chinese path but onkthrough a truly Indian path.

    repression drives a wedge in the hghting unityof the masses and invariably leads to the path ofsurrender. So, in the present era during any massmovement, active resistance movement will haveto be organized. The programme of active resistance has become an absolute necessity beforeany mass movement. Without this programme
    to organize any mass movement today means to
    plunge the masses in despondency. As a resultf the passive resistance of 1959, it was not possible to organize any mass rally on the demandfor food in Calcutta in the years 1960-61. Thorganization of active resistance will arouse anew confidence in the minds of the masses andthe tide of struggle will arise. What do we meanby active resistance? First, preservation of cadresor
    Is preservation of cadres, proper shelters
    and communication system are necessary. Secondly, teaching the common people the techniques of resistance, like lying down in thee faceof firings, or taking the helpofsome strong bar.rier, forming barricades, etc. Thirdly, efforts toavenge every attack with the help of groups ofactive cadres, which has been described by Comrade Mao Zedong as "Tit for tat struggle.

    Negro resistance movement of America
    5) There is no clear-cut idea in the Party abouthe underground organization. A secret organization does not grow merely if a few leaders stayunderground. On the contrary, these very leaders face the danger of getting isolateed from theparty ranks. If party leaders go underground andwork as leaders of open mass organizations, theywill invariably get arrested. So the undergroundleadership will have to go forward with the workof building a secret party. So, it is not a fact thathe task of forming

    a secret party Is solely
    of thee underground leaders, every party member should work for the secret organization andhrough those new party cadres the Party's linkswith the masses will be established. Only thenhe underground leaders will be able to work aseaders, So in this era. the main call before the

But wouldsuch views be accepted? No such assurance hasbeen given by Harekrishna Babu. But if theJLROS reject the Krishak Sabhas views, the peasants would under no circumstances be permittedto occupy land forcibly. Harekrishna Babu lostno time in making himself clear on this point
    What is this? Is it not acting like a bill-collectorof the government and iotedars? Even Congressmen would not have dared plead on behalf of thefeudal classes so unashamedly. Therefore, obeying the instructions of the party leaders wouldmean blindly accepting the feudal

    Therefore, economism causes a breach in theunity of fighting peasants and makes the landlessan
    Poor peasants frustrated
    vocates of econ
    omism judge every movement by the quantity ofpaddy in maunds or of land in bighas that thepeasant gets. Whether the peasant's fighting con-
    Sciousness has increased or not, 1s never their
    yardstick. So they do not make any effort to raisehe peasants class consciousness. Yet we knowlat no struggle can be waged without makingsacrifices. Chairman Mao has taught us thatwhere there Is struggle, there is sacrifice. At theinitial stage of the struggle the strength of reaction must be greater than the strength of the
    massesTherefore, the struggle willbe protractd.
    Since the masses are the progressive force, their
    strenIgth will increase day after day but as the
    reactionary forces are moribund, their strengthwill decline steadily. So, no revolutionary strug-gle can be successful unless the masses are rousedto make sacrifices. From this basic revolutionaryoutlook, economism leads on to the blind alleof bourgeois outlook. This is what the party leaders are trying to achieve throug

Lenin has said that even if some progressive legislation Is enacted but bureaucracy 1sgiven the charge of implementing it, the peasantswill get nothing. So, our leaders have gone a longdistance off the revolutionary path. Agrarian revolution is the task of this very moment: this taskcannot be left undone, and without doing this
    nothing good can be done for the peasants. But
    efore carrying out agrarian revolution, destruc
    tion of state power is necessary. Striving foragrarian revolution without destruction of State
    Prower means outright revisionism. So, destruc-tion of State power is today the first and principal task of peasant movement. If this cannot bedone on a country-wide, state-wide basis, willthe peasants wait silently? No, Marxism-leninism-mao Zedong Thought has taught us that ifin any area the peasants can be roused politicallthen we must go ahead with the task of destroying State power in thaat area

    e Class enemies. For bullding uIp this liberated
    area we need the armed force of the peasants
    When we speak of the armed force we have inmind the arms made by the peasants. So also wewant arms. Whether the peasants have come forward to collect awns or not is the basis on
    IC
    we shall judge whether they have been politicallroused. Where from shall the peasants get guns?
    The class enemies have guns and they live in thevillage. Guns have to be taken forcibly fromhem. They will not hand over their arms to usvoluntarily. Therefore, we shall have to seize gunsforcibly from them. For this, peasant militantswill have to be taught all tactics, right from setting fire to the houses of class enemies. Besideswe shall secure guns from the armed forces of the
    Government by attacking them all on a sudden
    Thee area In which we are able to organise thisgun-collection campaign shall quickly be transformed into a liberated area. So, for carrying outtis task it is necessary to propagate extensivelyamong the peasants the politics of building up

    that of poor and landless peasants. So
    e cannot be a participant inthee struggle right at

    Mao Zedong had
    herefore, taken up this task
    first and was able to point out infallibly the pathof revolutionary struggle. So the first point ofour organisational work is establishing the leadership of poor and landless peasants in the peasant movements. It is in thele process of organising
    Peasant movement on the basis of the politics ofarmeed strugglethat the leadership of thee poor
    and landless peasants will be established. Becauseof the peasant classes, they are the most revolu-tionary. A separate organisation of agriculturallabourers will not help this task. Rather, a separate organisation ofagricultural labourersencourages the trend towards trade union movement based on economism and intensites con

    cultural system the exploitation of feudal classesis foremost. Another question that comes up inhis very context is that of compromise withsmall owners. What shall be the Communistsoutlook in this regard? In regard to compromiseswe shall have to consider whom do we support.
    So, we cannot support any other class as againstthem. In the peasant movement (in India)the
    Communists have always been compelled to give
    P the Interests of poor and landless peasants inhe interest of the petty-bourgeoisie. This weakens the fighting determination of the poor andlandless peasants. In regard to middle and richpeasants also we should have different stand. Ifwe look upon rich peasants as middle peasants,the poor and landless peasants will be frustratedgain, if we look upon middle peasants as richpeasants, the fighting enthusiasm of the middlepeasants will diminish. So, the Communistsmust learn to make class analysis of peasants inevery area in accordance with Chairman Mao s
