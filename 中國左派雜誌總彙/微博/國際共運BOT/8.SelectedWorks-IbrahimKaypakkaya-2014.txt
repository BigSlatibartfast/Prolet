    INTRODUCTION
    COMMUNIST MANIFEST OF TURKEY REVOLUTION
    As in all countries; there have been many revolutionist and communist leaders in Turkey ( Turkey Kurdistan ), too
    Each of them contributed so much to revolution or communismstruggle. They have existed in Turkey revolution history and in oppressed peoples mind and heart as significant personages and will alwavs exist
    But some of them deserve to be exceptional. Their personalitiesinevitably indentified with revolutions political and social charactersbecause they historically shouldered and performed duties during certain moment of history
    Theirs most distinguishing point of other is that they revealed po-litical and personal country revolution's basic characteristics like finding a gem via the light of scientific socialism
    Leaders, who revealed this gem out, deserve definitely a specialace in duration of history. Their names have a talismanic mpact
    Here, Ibrahim Kaypakkaya merits to be mentioned such a historicapersonage

He became fairly the spirit of Turkerevolution.

    The area in which we have operated up to now is the sub-districttown ofk, which has 2 I villages within its boundaries. The distance tothe provicial capital is 70kms and the distance to the district centre is5kms. The main road linking the centre of Eastern Anatolia to Centraland Western Anatolia passes through this sub-district town. The eastern Taurus Mountains reach down to the land of this sub-district withthe high peaks and ranges of the Nurhak Mountains. The sub-district isgenerally made up of mountains and hills, which are treeless. Therevery little flat land. As befits such a hilly terrain the villages have beenestablished over a wide area. In somme villages it can take an hour towalk from one end to the other. The houses are generally next to arableland and the dwellings of those from the same family are usually closetogether and comprise a neighbourhood. Those who own sheep andgoats also have sheepfolds in the mountain pastures. On summer daysthe owners of these sheds ascend to them. This is the geographical andettlement situation of the area in which we are carrying out activities

The number of our comradeswho are politically advanced and relatively experienced is strictly limited. This is one of the problems that emerge when we send back wardand inexperienced comrades to the villages. That is, how will the smallnumber of advanced and partially comrades lead and train a large number of backward, inexperienced comrades?
    On the other hand, the content and form of our activities in ruareas has changed rapidly since our split from Shafak revisionism
    Forms of armed struggle, armed propaganda and methods of agitationhave replaced peaceful' propaganda and agitation. The atitude of theruling classes to revolutionary activity in general, and to revolutionaractivity in rural areas in particular, has also changed considerably. Theruling classes are launching ferocious attacks in order to prevent revo-lutionary activity In rural areas and to eradicate existing activity. Oneceipt of the tiniest scrap of information they mobilise large forces ofhundreds and thousands of troops to go after one or a handful of indi-viduals. For this reason it is no longer possible, particularly in the vil-lages, to carry out peaceful propaganda and agitation. We thereforehave to arm the cadre we send to rural areas and bring them to a position Where they may respond with arms to the armed assaults of theruling classes. Furthermore, the difficult conditions of the terrain alsorender it essential that we arm the cadres, even though our arms andmaterial strength are strictly limited. This is the second problem we encounter when sending new comrades to the rural areas, That is howwill we arm a large number (this figure is increasing by the day)ofcomrades with our very limited possibilities?

    Comrade, my main objections, criticisms and statement on thereplies you have given to a youth committees questions are as follows
    Firstly, let us look at what conditions Mao Tse-tung laid down for thesurvival and development of red political power in China(that is, of a fewsmall areas under red political power entirely encircled by the Whiteregime). In a draft resolution dated 5 October 1928 Mao Tse-tung prepared for the Hunan-kiangsi Border Area Second Party Congress afterwriting that"Red Political Power can exist and develop only undercertain conditions"(Mao Tse-tung, Why is it that Red Political Powercan exist in China? ), he listed these conditions thus
    First, It cannot occur in any imperialist country or in any colonyunder direct imperialist rule, but can only occur in China which is economically backward, and which is semi-colonial and under indirect imperialist rule. For this unusual phenomenon can occur only inconjunction with another unusual phenomenon, namely, war within the
    White regime(. ) Such a phenomenon is to be found in none of theimperialist countries nor for that matter in any colony under direct imperialist rule, but only in a country like China which is under indirect im
    Second, the regions where China,s Red political power has firstemerged and is able to last for a long time have not been those unaffectedby the democratic revolution where the masses of workers, peasants andsoldiers rose in great numbers. In many parts of these prunions and peasant associations were formed on a wide scale
    Third, whether it is possible for the peoples political power insmall areas to last depends on whether the nation-wide revolutionarysituation continues to develop. If the nation-wide revolutionary situation does not continue to develop but stagnates for a fairly long timethen it will be impossible for the small Red areas to last long. Actuallythe revolutionary situation in China is continuing to develop with thecontinuous splits and wars within the ranks of the comprador and land-lord classes and of the international bourgeoisie

    hese people are branding the independence struggle[oaabeing waged by our people and being the heirs of the complete independence principle of M.Kemal with revisionism. This is undoubtedly the attitude of a spendthrift. Those who shirk the revolutionarystruggle are looking down on the struggles of the past and are unableto comprehend the importance of making history a weapon in thisgreat struggle. This attitude and class character of theirs stems fromtheir petit bourgeois ideology that looks down on everything
    As we all know our National Liberation war was carried outunder the leadership of the national bourgeoisie and the leader of thenational revotution was M. Kema]". M. Kemal's principle of complete independence and our liberation war is such a tangible inheritance that tens of thousands of workers and peasants gave their bloodand sacrificed their lives for its sake. They did not shirk freom arselff-sacrifice. But as the workers and peasants were not organised thenational bourgeoisie seized the leadership of the national revolutionand, being unable to complete the bourgeois democratic revolutionestablished a dictatorship that oppressed the workers and peasant.
    The new Kemalist bourgeoisies dictatorship over the people came toa compromise with feudalism and imperialism, as necessitated by itscharacter. A collaborationist big bourgeoisie subsequently emergedfrom this new bourgeoisie, surrendering our country to the clutches ofimperialism. To expect a consistent proletarian stance from M. Kemalthen when this was not forthcoming to label him an imperialist collaborator, suits the bourgeois idealists. But it is evident that such anattitude is not appropriate for the proletarian movement
    The analyses of Lenin, Stalin and Mao-tse-tung regarding M

The proletarian wing has now cut all ties with therevisionist-bourgeois clique and embarked on reorganising on Marxist-
