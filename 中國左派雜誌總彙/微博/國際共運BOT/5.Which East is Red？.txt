    Chinese and their Albanian allies seemed isolated in their struggle: Chinawas the most populous country in the world and the second-largest socialist power, but after Sino-soviet Split saw the maiority of socialist nationsalign with the Soviets, while the North Vietnamese and North Koreanovernments vacillated between the two sides
    If the governments and parties of most socialist countries opposede new positionsthat Mao and the Chinese Communist Party weretaking, the same cannot be said of the broader international communistmovement. Indeed, communists across the First and Third worlds splitinto rival pro-moscow and pro-beijing "Maoist parties, each claimingto be the true heir of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. The world found itselfdoubling in number of leftist parties, often with the appellation"(Marxist-leninist) added to the end of the names of the new Maoist organizations. Usually starting out small, the Maoist parties grew over the coursef the " Global Sixties. For a time at least, student and youth movementsin many societies of both the First and Third Worlds found the Maoistmessage appealing: a refreshing and rebellious alternative to the revision-ist, reformist, and authoritarian pro-moscow parties of their elders. Forexample, the Black Panther Party and Revolutionary Union (later the Revolutionary Communist Party)in the US, the Gauche Proletarienne (Proletarian Left)in France, and African anticolonial groups such as the FNLA

    First and Third World, but a gap seems to exist: what about thee secon
    World? Apart from Albania, was Eastern Europe devoid of Maoism? Myresearch has found this not to be the case: a careful examination of even
    English-language sources at the margins of discourse around Maoism in2 In most literature,the diplomatic and ideological fracturing between the USSRand People's Republic of China is written as the "Sino-soviet split. However, Maoists then and now emphasize the term"split and stylize it as the "Sino-soviet Split,marking it as a particularly important part of socialist history. In keeping with the
    Maoist essence of this work, the term"Split"remains capitalized

    Introduction
    he Sixties shows that it was there. The advent of the Internet not onlallows us access to new sources (especially newly opened archives)aroundhe world, but also to connect to networks of veterans of the struggle aswell as scholars in the field. This research has certainly not been easy to
    undertakethankfully, my own years of personal study of Soviet history
    and Maoist theory helped make it possible to accomplish. Soviet archivesare still mostly inaccessible, with the Russian government divulging itssources only slowly and sporadically. Even other countries that are part ofthis study would have been impossible to research had it not been for my
    contacts inside Maoist organizations in those countrie.
    The present study is a challenge to these discourses that omit theeffects of the Sino-soviet Split and its effects on the Eastern Europeanintellectual world and to the arguments that Marxism and dissent in Eastern Europe were monolithic in being either pro-soviet or pro-western
    Why would the Eastern Bloc continue to be exempt from the zeitgeist ofhe Global Sixties? While these countries had extensive police surveillanceapparatuses (from the Stasi of the German Democratic Republic to theKGB of the USSR)that made it particularly difficult to organize new communist parties or militant groups, they certainly failed to prevent the East
    Wind” of China any more than the“ West Wind” of the American-led
    First World from blowing through their globally connected societies andcultures. Dissidents who held left-wing or Marxist-leninistconvictonsat variance with offcial doctrine and whose voices were silenced or lostshould be heard again as part of the new historical scholarship on the Second World, the Global Sixties, and the Cold War
    The structure and method
    of this study begins chronological
    with a presentation of the post-1949 alliance between the Soviet Unionand the newborn Peoples Republic of China. It then segues into a narrativeof the Sino-soviet Split and the ideological divergences between Moscowsand Beiiings interpretations of Marxism, or the clash between revisionism with Mao Zedong Thought. Each of the following chapters discuss
    Mao Zedong Thought, " and anti-revisionism are key terms
    In this study that oftentimes overlap or seem to be used Interchangeably: however,they are distinct terms in and of themselves. "Mao Zedong Thought"was the mostcommon appellation for what is today considered Maoist ideology, as the Chinese
    Communist Party and its international allies viewed Maos theories as not necessaribeing a new and higher stage of Marxism-leninism, but rather Marxism-leninism

    apter devoted tothe case of the Soviet Union. The study concludes witha thorough explanation of my challenge to fellow historians and a call tochange the way we view Eastern Europe during the Long Global Sixties
    It should be noted that this study glaringly omits the Socialist Feceral Republic of Yugoslavia, the Socialist Republic of Romania, and the
    Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. While there was indeed a brief attemptat a small group of youth to distribute the Serbo-croatian translation ofthe Quotations from Chainman Mao Tse-tung gifted to them by the Chineseembassy in Belgrade, their attempt was so brief and lacking in any successlat any significant discussion of Maoism in Yugoslavia (i.e. lack thereof,would be moot. While China and Romania had tepidly friendly diplomatic relations, I found no evidence of any attempts by romanian citizensto bring Maoism to their home country in any scholarly work on SINO-ROmanian relations; the exact same can be said of Czechoslovakia. Hopefullfuture studies on communist dissidence in the Eastern Bloc. however wibring to light any attempts to bring Maoism to these countries during the1960sand1970s.

    construction of my narrative.

    Even before his own revolution, Lenin saw a revolutionary stormculminating In Asia.
    Speaking about Xinhai Revolution of 1911-1912 that overthrewhe Qing Dynasty and established China's first republic, Lenin proclaimedlat China is a land of seething political activity, the scene of a virile socialmovement and of a democratic upsurge and that the rise of anticolonialand left-leaning democratic movements across Asia was a promising newdevelopment alongside the communist movements of World War I taking form among the European working class. As the Communist International ( Comintern)developed in the wake of the Russian Revolutionand with the founding of the Chinese Communist Party(CCP)in 1921the Soviets now had a stake in Chinas political trajectory. Eager to helpfoment world revolution. Moscow sent Comintern agents into China tohelp along the infant CCP in its struggle to become a party with a massbase capable of seizing power
    However, the Comintern and the Communist Party of the Soviet
    Union (CPSU)advised the Chinese Communists to take a unique route

    form a"united front with the ruling Guomindang(Nationalist Party, hereafter known as the GMD). This arrangement, which came to be knownas the First United Front of 1923, created a political dynamic where theCCP and GMD achieved a uniquely close symbiosis. Joint membership in
    parties became a near-requirement for CCP members and the CCPwas able to put prominent cadres into the highest ranks of the GMDall in hopes that not only would a GMD-CCP alliance unite China, butwould steer the GMD into becoming a socialist party itself (indeed, the
    Soviets were keen on the possibility that the GMD could eventuallJointhe Comintern
    While the Chinese Communists certainly saw the First United
    Front as an excellent opportunity for the growth of their party, it shouldbe noted that the move was only semi-voluntary. In theory, thee cominternacted as a worldwide council of communist parties in which all parties hadan equal say and overall self-determination. In reality, the CPSU had anunspoken final say in all matters, even at a global level, and by the 1930she Comintern's central task had essentially become one of defending the
    Soviet Union as the nucleus of a nascent socialist world. Even during
    Lenins tenure as leader of the USSR, deviating in any way from the blue-print given by the Comintern was going to be exceedingly difficult for theCCB if not outright verboten
    The United Front was at first a successful endeavor: it created the
    National Revolutionary Army (NRA) of the GMD, which was able tounite Communists and Nationalists into a fighting force seeking to ridChina of its warlord dilemma. In 1926. the NRA launched the successful
    Northern Expedition that mopped up the eastern warlords and broughthem loosely under a party-state dominated by Chiang Kai-shek. The honeymoon between the CCP and GMD broke down: GMD leader Chiangtired of the Communists attempts to swing the GMD to the left. He dissolved the First United Front midway through the Expedition, and on 12
    April 1927 NRA forces loyal to Chiang launched a massacre of Chinese
    Communist Party members in Shanghai, sparking the beginning of the

    CCPS insurgency that would last until 1949. While thee warlordsuffered critical defeats in the Northern Expedition, the CCPS strict fol-lowing of Moscow's orders to refrain from pursuing an independent pathfrom the GMD ended in bloody tragedy.
    The Soviets were quick to condemn Chiang (although the cessationof relations between the Comintern and the GMD was a gradual oneand the Chinese Communist Party fed to the countryside to begin itsrevolutionary "peoples war, Moscow was overjoyed that a communistrevolution had broken out in the world's most populous country, evenif it was initiated in a manner contrary to Comintern policy at the time
    Unfortunately, due to the CCP'S lack of holding territory on the Sovi-et-chinese border, the Soviets were unable to supply the new revolutionwith arms, money, or extra Comintern agents. According to Edgar Snow1938 classic report on the Chinese communist movement, Red Star Over
    China, the Chinese Reds fought with less material foreign help than anyarmy in modern Chinese history.
    In June 1941, the German Reich attacked the USSR with all itsmight. While the Japanese had yet to engage the Soviets and were preoccupied with fighting in China and Manchuria, Japan was still part of the Axis
    Powers and thus an indirect enemy of Moscow. Across Europe and China
    Moscow gave its moral and advisory support to the Chinese Communists,who formed an anti-japanese"Second United Front with the GMD in1937. United against a common enemy, the GMD and CCP helped expelhe Japanese from China, and in August 1945, mere weeks before the endof the war, the Soviet Red Army swooped in to liberate Manchuria andte northern half of Korea from Japanese occupation. With two atomicbombs dropped on Japan, Manchuria gone, and Japanese forces in Chinadecimated, Japan surrendered to the Allies
    The Second United Front crumbled almost immediately thereafter and the Chinese Civil War surged on until the victory of the Peoples
    Liberation Army in 1949. On 1 October 1949, in Tiananmen Square

    Party of the Soviet Union(CPSU), where Stalin congratulated the ChiInese
    Communist Party for its victory over the GMD and its founding of the

During Maos Moscow visit, the Chinese and Sovietsstruck a deal that would allow the Soviet Union to send economic advisersall across China to aid in Chinas post-revolution restructuring.

    Post-liberation relations between China and the Soviet Union werestill tense, however. While Stalin was impressed that Mao had achievedvictory against the Jabanese anId the Guomindang by going against Moscows specific orders, a sense of resentment remained and Stalin contin-ued to exercise dominance over Mao to maintain his position as head ofhe socialist bloc. The Comintern had been dissolved in 1943. but theUSSR still saw itself, to an extent, as the undisputed leader and architectof the Postwar socialist order. 4 Still. when the Korean War broke out on25 June 1950, the Chinese and Soviets unconditionally united alongsidethe Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea out of fear that a Korea unitedunder a Seoul government could be used as a"jumping off point for USattacks on China. 1) The Soviet-chinese alliance. however tenuous, beganto crack when Stalin died on 5 March 1953 mere months before the armistice between North and South Korea on 27 July

    An important point should be made about the motivations of the
    March rioters in terms of ideology: not all the demonstrators were Stalin-ists, much less Maoist. Many Geeorglans simDly opposed Khrushchev asan incompetent leader who ignored the needs of non-russian Soviet citizens. For some, it was a sheer matter of Georgian nationalism while veryew were explicitly anticommunist, some protesters began to call for the
    Georgian SSR to leave the USSR. This eclecticism, the motley of motivations for opposing the new Soviet order, was to characterize other manitestations of organized anti-revisionism across the 1950s through the 1970s
    While some of the demonstrators had reached out to China. the
    Chinese said nothing in regards to the uprisings. Even Zhu De, who hadsaluted the crowd and had one of his delegates speak at one of the ral-lies, was completely silent on the matter From a geopolitical viewpointhis is honestly unsurprising,. Mostly likely, it could be wagered, a majorpro-chinese uprising against the Soviet establishment by the Soviet peoples was not on the table for Beijing at this particular point. After all, the
    Sino-soviet Split had only begun: indeed, both countries were still in thestage of the Split where they hoped that a full schism could bee prevented

Thefirst manifestation of the Brezhney Doctrine came three years after thenew General-secretary assumed power, with the swift and brutal invasionof Czechoslovakia in retaliation to the 1968"Prague Spring. The Chineseand Albanians were quick to condemn the invasion, citing it as evidenceof the USSR'S true nature as an imperialist aggressor which pro-beijingparties echoed across the world. In contrast, the majority of Soviet citizenry (and pro-moscow communist parties)passively supported or keptsilent about the Brezhnev Doctrine, except for a small incident in Red

    Does this mean the vast maiority of Soviet citizens subscribed to thegeneral line of the CPSU? Surely not: treating any population in a heavilycontrolled society as either fully complicit or fully secretly dissident is irrational. The USSR was a country of over a hundred different nationalitieswith generations that had grown up with distinct experiences. The postwar,

    1965 was a watershed year for the Soviet Union: while the Chinesewere still a year away from the Cultural Revolution, Premier Kosygin oversaw a complete overhaul of the Gosplan(State Planning Committee)anda drastic change in the direction of the Soviet economy.

    At first experimentation in profit was confined to a few targets-particularly garmententerprises and lightindustries, but by 1968, 72%o Sovietenterprises were fixed to profit to one extent or another. While enterpriseswere still not free to determine what they would produce and where theyrould buy and sell, the 1965 reforms enlarged the autonomy of theseenterprises by giving leeway to managers within enterprises in termsdecision-making about planning, incentives, employment, profit, andinvestment. At more points than not, the Soviet planners put ideologyentirely aside when agreeing to link the calculation of profitability to

They referred to the Sovietsystem as monopoly capitalism"(echoing the Maoists). They dmandethe removal from power of state bureaucrats after a class struggle by theworkers. Later that year they formed a commune outside Leningrad; by thespring 1978 the group now had begun to call itself the"Left Oppositionand began publishing the journal Prospekt(Prospects). Fellow thinkersfrom Moscow, Gorky, and other cities planned to join them upon readingle journal but 40 of them were arrested on their way. A few months later,the entire commune was arrested, with Tsurkov serving five years in prison

    It is important to note that in the text Alexeyeva, as pro-westernas she is, writes clearly that " those who wished to subvert the Soviet sys-tem were rare among dissidents, actually an isolated few. This is an interesting proclamation. Although written three decades ago, it is worth revisiting in order to gain a new view of the other-thinker terrain. 8
    The final tale of a notable attempt within the Soviet Union to buildan anti-revisionist Marxist-leninist movement documented in either Russian or English is the story of the Workers Centre led by workers Grigori Isaev and Alexei Razlatsky. Razlatsky was an oil engineer living in
    Samara who had been brought up in an intellectual family and had already67Ibid.,423.

    discourse. While anyone who would not be described as a true"Marx
    Ist-leninist in mainstream Soviet press was seen as being a danger to socialorder and needed to be suppressed, these persons might not have necessarily been labeled as an agent of foreign-fomented sedition. Anti-soviet, yes, but not necessarily anticommunist. Either way, it is telling thatmost of those arrested and convicted for membership in these organiza
    tions or who attempted to promote an anti-revisionist line were givenprison sentences of only a tew years, a hne, or simple expulsion trom the
    Party or Komsomol (this contrasts to pro-western dissidents, who weregiven long or even life sentences in the gulags) Is telling about how
    Soviet state viewed these anti-cpsu Marxist-leninists. It seems that thecategory of dissyidenti-which had more traitorous connotations-is butone part of the broader concept of inakomyslyashchii(the other-thinkers)
    Second: why did Soviet anti-revisionism fai? Why was the mostpowerful and populous of the Warsaw Pact countries one of thee countriesthere anti-revisionism manifested the least in Eastern Europe? Despite ahorough investigation, it seems that anti-revisionism of either a Maoist or
    Neo-stalinist type was a series of micro-movements that regularly sprungup, but were perpetually conned to Isolated individuals, tiny parties, s
    or
    to the actions of Chinese government officials living or working in th
    Soviet Union, with the Tbilisi Uprising and the Workers Centre strikersbeing the only exceptions of note. With all things considered, anti-revisionism is a fash in the pan in Soviet history, with only a few sparks of specific Maoism within it
    Permit me to posit a few of my own hypotheses of what contributed to the stifling of Maoism in the USSR. For starters, chipping awayat the hegemony of the CPSU would have been exceedingly difficult: theideological landscape of the USSR was so monolithic that to perceive anything as being left in form, right in essence (as Mao would say)wouldbe conceptually borderline impossible. There was nothing in the Sovietconcept of the development of communism that could be comparableto Mao's moreanarchic concept of ideological struggle (i.e. the Cultural Revolution), with struggle being cemented as a police matter or asa matter of the top levels marginalizing of theose at the ower levels whomay have different ideas on the direction the CPSU was to go. All otherstrains of leftist thought were perceived as either not having reached the

    sophistication of Soviet Marxist-leninism or deviated from the correctpath towards inevitable counter-revolutionary hijacking and had become
    a threat tothe project of socialism overtaking capitalism globally(as in the
    case of Maoism)
    It is also important to notice that, compared to later chapters of thishesis, Chinese embassy dissemination of Maoist literature to the common
    Soviet citizen is significantly lower than efforts by the ChInese embaassiesin other Warsaw Pact countries such as East Germany or Hungary. Perhaps the Chinese didn't want to risk funding a full-blown revolt againstthe Soviet government because of the military pressure the Soviets hadon them, instead preferring to chip away at the edges of its empire? The
    Chinese had already clashesd with the Soviets enoughth both within Chinaand in Pla-soviet Army border skirmishes: being accused of fomentingdissent within Soviet borders might only escalate already-seething hostiities. In the end, Soviet Maoists may have been "left hanging because ofsheer realpolitik on the part of the Chinese Communist Party.
    One must also take into account that Soviet society was a vast sur-veillance state. The KGB, Party, and Komsomol maintained firm socialand judicial control in the USSR up until the coming of Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika, and Brezhnev had taken steps to reverse much ofhe Khrushchev Thaw's social openness. Phones were easily tapped, the
    Dost routinely searched and censordand every workplace and Institu
    tion of learning had KGB agents posted to them. All forms of press werestate-owned and only through some samizdat (self-published)publicationsand periodicals do we see any amount of independent written word. Thevast amount of state oversight over-and surveillance within-the Komsomol also made it nearly impossible for youth to organize clandestine dissent that could operate for any signifcant length of time
    Adding to this was the fact that this police state stretched over 86-millon square miles of forest, mountains, desert, steppe, and tundra. in an ageetore the internet and w1thno discreet torms ot communication In order
    to network with one another, any attempt at building an all-union Marxist-leninist party across such vast swathes of land would be easily doomedto fail. In the end, Maoism(and broader anti-revisionism )in the Soviet
    Union was not a storm, but a mere sporadic cloudburst

    As the Soviet Bloc countries closed ranks against China, one East-ern European country stepped forward as the sole defender of their com-rades in Beijing, Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labour of Albania (Partiae Punes e Shqiperise, or PPSH)denounced Khrushchev's Destalinizationand took it upon themselves to be supporters of Stalin and opponents of

    Labour and its mass organizations. At a meeting in Shanghai in late summer of 1967, two Albanian PPSH cadres were sent by Hoxha to requestan Albanian translation of the Little Red Book.

    The Ideological and Cultural Revolution had a curious beginni8
    Originally, Hoxha had declared in 1961 that"internal economic and socialconditions for the restoration of capitalism have now been eliminated in
    Albania]"and that class struggle was no longer necessary within the Partyor society. However, uponthe outbreak of the Cultural Revolution in
    China, Hoxha abruptly reversed this summation and seemingly changedideological course entirely. 2 The Albanian Cultural Revolution startedwith a notable number of reforms: the abolition of ranks in the militaryreintroduction of political commissars into the armed forces, sendingmid-to-high level officials to work in factories and fields, collectivizationof remote mountain areas, and a concentrated effort to keep out foreign
    Infuences

Ironically, around thetime Chinese authorities began to discourage Red Guards from destroying ancient temples, relics, and other symbols of the Old World, Hoxhahad begun his own campaign of wiping away the"Old Albania. In hisown variation of Maos theory of the role of superstructure in the pro-cess of a cultural revolution, the Albanian government decreed the superstructure must get rid of all retrograde things and foreign elements. Inother words, Hoxha justified it with the inappropriateness of the basis withthe superstructure. 55
    Despite the inspiration of the Cultural Revolution of China, the
    Albanian Cultural Revolution never reached the massive scale of the former. The Albanian Youth were only used to attack religious institutionsand already-toppled landlords, and there were no mass workers of wom
    ens organlzationsthat
    articularly aided in the attack on the old soci-
    ety. Unlike the PLA in China, the Albanian People's Army was consigned
    mainly tothe background, acting as something to be transformed rather
    han a tool with which to transform In the end, it was a top-down initiative orchestrated primarily by Hoxha himself. The Ideological and Cultural
    Revolution was launched for more calculated and pragmatic reasons thanhe ideological convictions that Mao held which caused him to launch the
    Chinese Cultural Revolution. The Albanians knew that officially breaking from the Warsaw Pact would cause serious military and economic set-backs, and that they needed to be ready to weed out any form of socialvuinerability 87

    Bloc as the Sino-soviet break had become irreversible. with one of themost dramatic-and high-ranking-being the military coup attempt in
    Sofia, Bulgaria in April 1965. While partially a symptom of the sino->0viet Split, it was also the inevitable conclusion of a major split that hadarisen between particular factions within the Bulgarian Communist Partyhe Chervenkov faction(Stalinist, anti-revisionist), the Yugov faction(more nationalistic, known for opportunistic vacillation), and the prevail

    growing over the process of twenty years: even as early as 1945 there wasa distinct split between the home communists and the Muscovites

    Bulgarian intelligence had been monitoring some of the individual plotters and supporters for some time, and by the first week of April a wave ofarrests, purges, and demotions swept through the Party and Army, endingin Todorov-gorunyas suicide on 7 April. 03
    The coup attempt was unprecedented. With the exception of a coupattempt in 1960 in Albania, any attempt at a military overthrow of a Soviet
    Bloc state was seen as simply impossible. How could this have happened, and how could the BCP explain it? Rumors and official state explanations began to fly. Western media such as Time magazine suggested that
    Todorov-gorunya and company were plotting a"pro-peking putschand were directly inspired by Maos opposition to Soviet social-imperialism. The Chicago Tribune reported that Zhivkov had declared the conspirators were pro-chinese elements.. people of primitive thinking106

    At certain times in the revolutionary struggle, the difficulties outweighthe favorable conditions and so constitute the principal aspect of thecontradiction and the favorable conditions constitute the secondaryaspect. But through their efforts the revolutionaries can overcome thedifficulties step by step and open up a favorable new situation; thus adifticult situation yields place to a favorable one

    The West German SDS were not the only German youth who wereshouting Maos name to defy Moscow. On the other side of the Berlin
    Wall, a small group of East German communists of a younger generation(also joined by a small group of older, hardline communists who survivedthe concentration camps of the Nazis)reached out to their fellow countrymen in the West who had already formed a cohesive Maoist party namedthe Communist Party of Germany/Marxist-leninist (Kommunistische
    Partei Deutschlands/Marxisten-leninisten. or KPD/ML). The KPD/MLhad been looking to form a German Democratic Republic(GDR)Sec-tion for some time, hoping to harness dissatisfaction among East German

    destruction of the German Reich itself, split into two by the Allies andmuch of its eastern territories absorbed into Poland as geographic paybackor wartime atrocities. The Soviet Red Army established a German Eco-nomic Commission (Deutsche Wirtschaftskommission, or DWK)in 1947to direct the construction of a socialist economy. Reparations to be paido the other Eastern Bloc nations was almost immediately forced upon the
    Germans by the DW/K, creating the basis for an economy intended to bea near-complete replication"down to the last machine, down to thee astproduction unit of industry") of Moscows model for the duration of
    East Germanys existence. In 1949, the DWK was dissolved and economic
    Planning was handed over to the government oof the newly declared Ger-man Democratic Republic and the Soviet-manufactured SED ruling party.
    Even after the transition from direct Soviet administration to EastGerman domestic rule and the denazification of society, the new political
    and economic model did not serve the German people well, Including
    industrial working class that it was supposed to be ruled by. The average
    East German's monthly income was 256 Deutsche Marks a month, withprices for even single items of food being up to a third of that income
    Riots and uprisings ensued across 1953 and by the end of the year, SED
    General Secretary Walter Ulbricht tried to curtail further discontent by
    enacting a series of significant economic reforms under a policy known as
    he"New Course. The New Course, while meant to satisfy the populace,deviated from the traditional model of socialist planning by-much likehe policies of Khrushchev and Brezhnev in the Ussr-halting collectivization of agriculture and returning property to farmers and enterpriseowners(particularly if they had fled to the West after having their propertyseized) 117
    Over twenty years later, in 1967 a new policy known as the"Economic System of Socialism added reforms to the setting of wages andprices, as well as the autonomy of management of enterprises. Ulbricht,

    much like Khrushchev, was seen as incompetent in moving the economicreforms forward and in 1971 was replaced with the much more Brezhnev-esque( and Brezhnev-aligned)Erich Honecker. Much like the Kosygin
    Reforms did for Soviet anti-revisionists, the Economic System of Socialismwould later be used by the East German Maoists of the KPD/ML as evidence that the GDRS economy was a capitalist one and that the SED wasa junior partner in the CPSU'S social-imperialist policies
    1968 was a whirlwind year that left no part of the world untouchedincluding the socialist countries. The Prague Spring in Czechoslovakiaattempted to turn the Czechoslovak regime on its head, resulting in the
    Soviet invasion of the country and the crushing of the movement. Meanwhile in China, the Cultural Revolution had reached a screeching crescendo, with the Red Guards and other radical mass movements havingspun out of Maos control and leaving the country in what Maao caedan all-around civil war. It was also a year that gave birth to even more
    Maoist parties(many far more radical and youth-oriented thaan the initwave of Maoist parties a few years earlier), including the KPD/ML in West
    Germany (Federal Republic of Germany, or FRG). Meanwhile, in the Easthe youth of 1968 began to form a Maoist nucleus via radical study circlesin which they studied the " classics of Marx, Engels, and Lenin independent of their high school and university Marxism-leninism classes, as well
    as the officially disapproved works of Stalin, Mao, and Hoxha
    In 1969, the Progressive Youth (Progressive Jugend, or P )wasfounded in Magdeburg. The PJ only had around a hundred ful-time cad-

    East German authorities). By the early 1970s the PJ had supporters notonly in Magdeburg and Berlin but in the key port city of Rostock, allowng it to form an even broader base.
    The PJ eventually reached out to the KPD/ML in the FRG andormed a GDR Section of the Party. On 7 February 1976, a pamphlettitled Declaration of the Founding of the GDR Section of the KPD/ML, was published, with the first page of the pamphlet topped with theheads of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao. 24 The pamphlet containeda program for the new communist party as well as a series of writingsdenouncing the East German economic model as a"thoroughly capitalistprogram_>and the SEDas“ traitors of the nation” and vassals of Mos
    Cow. 2 It was an incendiary text declaring all-out class war on the stateand intending to carry it to total victory. Like their Western comradeshe Maoists of the KPD/ML GDR Section had succeeded in becoming
    Chinese, transferring the Chinese aesthetic onto themselves and the Red
    Guards goal of destroying revisionism by any means necessary.
    The GDR Section began printing its own edition of the Partys central newspaper Rote Morgen("Red Morning )and disseminateing It aroun
    university campuses and stufhng copies of the newspaper regularly into
    the mailboxes of working-class neighborhoods. 2 While only havinga membership in the dozens, the GDR Section held together the smallbase of East German citizens sympathetic to anti-revisionism as the PJhad, quickly arousing the wrath of the powerful Ministry of State Security
    commonly known as the Stasi).Avoiding the Stasi was as impossible to

    While the GDR had experienced a decade of small but vibrant Mao-st activity, its time as a cohesive vanguard political party for Maoism lasteda mere two years. In 1978 the KPD/ML, including its GDR Section, sidedwith the Albanians in the Sino-albanian Split, and in 1986 the new Hoxhaist incarnation of the KPD/ML dissolved its GDR Section while merg-ing with the International Marxist Group to found the Unified Socialist
    Party, which dwindled away across the late 1980s. 3 East German Maoismhad failed to build a popular base or become a serious threat to the SED
    regime(although the Stasi certainly treated it as such), and Soviet-style
    communism continued to be the only school of Marxist the

    East German people were engaged with until the fall of the Berlin Wall in1989.

    Through a Western lens, the German Democratic Republic and the

    The Maoist Incident: Effects of Political and Ideological Consolidationon Youth Mentality in the Kadar Regime of the 1960s has divulged keynew information about the Maoist student rebels of 1968 and their connections to broader global social movements of the decade. 140 It spins a taleof fiercely idealistic youth who, inspired by the national liberation strug-gles in the Third World (particularly that of Viletham), Sought a vibrantseemingly anti-authoritarian socialism beyond their nation's borders, andthe political and intellectual response to the incident. Like their comradesin Western Europe and the two Germanys, these youth found the anti-authoritarianism they needed in Maoism
    Like the Kosygin Reforms of 1965 in USSR and the Economic System of Socialism in the GDR of 1967, the conception of Hungarian Maoism is rooted in economic reforms. Goulash Communism--known forits use of free market mechanisms and small private enterprises within abroader state-planned apparatus-was the product of Kadars "New Eco
    nomicMechanism initiated across 1966 to 1968. Like the Bulgarian
    reforms of the early 1960s, Goulash Communism was also a process ofsidelining hardline Stalinists, mainly centered around the first poostwar
    Party leader Matyas Rakosi. The dual process of open economic reformsand sidelining of the authoritarian oldguard seems to act, In my ownobservation, as a formula for creating bursts of antz-authoritarian antl-revi
    sionism in 1960s Eastern Europe, and the student study groups found on
    Budapest university campuses serve as yet another example of this formula
    The first central figure of Hungarian Maoism was a young Hungarian Communist Youth League(CYL)activist named Gabor Revai.

Like his East German comrades, his beginnings as an opposition activist lay in his forming of studentstudy circles of Marxist classics outside the approved CYL study groupsin 1964. Two years later, Revai became friends with prominent WestGerman student activist Rudi Dutschke. to whom he was introduced in
    Budapest in 1966 by Ferenc Janossy, the stepson of esteemed Marxist phiosopher Gyorgy Lukacs, WI
    whom he maintained a correspondence. 44
    With such esteemed connections, Revai was seemingly destined to becomea troublemaker for the Kadarist status quo
    Soon Revai linked u
    ith other likeminded intellectuals within
    the HS WP and CYL. Among the core circle was Gyorgy Por and Miklos
    Haraszti, two other CYL activists at Eotvos Lorand University, Gyorgy

    The final significant example of Maoism in the Soviet Bloc comesin the form of a curious and complicated man. Kazimierz Miial was aman with impressive credentials born in 1910 in the Polish region ofthe Russian Empire, he grew up to help found the Polish Workers' Partyand fought the Nazis within the ranks of the communist Peoples Guard
    Gwardia Ludowa)and Polish Peoples Army(Armia Ludowa)from 1942until Poland's liberation in 1945. 7IN the 1950s he became mayor oflOazand then served as Minister of the Communal Economy and Chief of the
    Bureau for the Council of Ministers. 68 For a man with such an alreadyprestigious background, Mijal seemed destined to greatness within thenewly formed ruling Polish United Workers Party(Polska Zjednoczona
    Partia Robotnicza, or PZPR)
    His career took a downward plunge, however, with the death of hisgood friend and political ally Boleslaw Bierut, who had served as Presidentof the Polish People's Republic and First Secretary of the PZPR from 1947

    until his death in 1956. 6bierut was succeeded by Wladyslaw Gomulkawhose economic reforms in October 1956(the"Gomulka Thaw)70 werea near lock-and-step emulation of Khrushchev's own thaw. A transcriptof a report by Radio Free Europe concerning Miijal's newfound dilemmainforms us that In the beginning, like his like-minded companions, hedid not openly enter into factional struggle. He still acted under so-called
    Party democracy, though giving fullrein to virulent attacks on more Iberagroups. A few weeks after the Poznan uprising by Polish workers in June1956), the Seventh CC Plenum met, in the course of which the Natolinhardline faction violently attacked the thaw tendencies in the Party and
    tried to bussh through the view that the Poznan tragedy
    prove
    at the
    liberalization of rule had led the Party into danger and demanded thata strong-arm policy be restored. For the first time, clearly demagogicalmethods were employed, such as antisemitic allusions, mention of pur-osely fanned anti-soviet feelings, etc. The plenum did issue a compromiseresolution, but it was known that it failed to solve the main problem-thedeep rift between the Party factions. After the plenum, the final act in thestruggle for power began. 171
    In January 1957, Mijal was removed from the Ministry of Communal Economy and at the Third Congress of the PZPR in 1959 he wasnot reelected to the Central Committee. 172Once more, we see the twinphenomena of economic reform and political sidelining giving birth toanti-revisionist discontent. After some years of silence, Mijal published in1963-with the help of the Albaalans
    -a pamphlet titled "The Struggle
    for Victory! Silence and Passivity Mean Defeat! which was smuggled into
    Poland via Chinese ships. 7s After 10,000 copies were distributed acrossthe country, multiple arrests ensued and Mijal was sacked of all political posts and party membership. In December 1965, a new pamphlettitled Under the Marxist-leninist Banner. Into a Battle for Socialism!

    was released and distributed illegally among the Polish puubic, announche formation of the "Communist Party of Poland(or Cpp-alsoknown as the Communist Party of Poland (marxist-leninist)or Commu-nist Party of Poland (Mija)). The pamphlets initiated another wave ofarrests, with estimates between 30 and 300 jailed (although some sourcesindicate the majority were just detained for questioning), demonstratinghat the new party was not simply an Albanian-sponsored one-man paper
    Polish
    organization, but a group large enough to cause concern for the Poauthorities
    Miial and his comrades minced no words in proclaiming which
    East they viewed as genuinely"red. Party literature stated that"the center of the revolution has shifted east.... Marxist positions are maintainedby Parties such as those of China, Indonesia, Korea, Vietnam, Albania, and
    New Zealand. 177 Mao was referred to as thee most outstandingtheaoristof Marxist-leninist thought of the time and that a cultural revolution in
    Poland was necessary for the country to reorient itself onto the socialistroad. 7 Yet the CPP seemed isolated other than some material aid from
    Tirana. The Chinese, in fact, maintained complete silence on their Polishcomrades for some three years. It was not until August 1968 that Beijingfinally recognized the CPB, stating in Peking Review that "Comrade Mao
    Tse-tung has pointed out that a party is a revolutionary party ifit integratesheory with practice in a revolutionary way, maintains constant links withhe broadest sections of the masses, and adopts a serious attitude towardits own mistakes. The vanguard of the Polish working class-the Polish
    Communists-under the banner of the Communist Party of Polandresolved to build such a revolutionary party which will be faithful to the
    roletarlat foreverThe CCP particularly praised the Poles for allowingonly the most militant and self-sacrificing workers to be members, withanti-nazi resistance veterans to act as the backbone of the party. 79

    Across the next two years, the CCP would shower heaps of praiseupon the CPP in Peking Review and Mao continually received Mijal atstate functions. b0 The Polish Maoists seem unique in the amount of vocalsupport given to them by Beijing: coverage of the Poles in Chinese statepress was disproportionately greater than that of Maoists in other Soviet
    Bloc countries, most of which were ignored.I The CPP in return show-ered praise onto the Chinese Cultural Revolution in its newspaper Red
    Flag and declared it as a model applicable to their own struggles. Inreading articles concerning Eastern Europe in Chinese English-languageperiodicals, one could infer that the Chinese were using the CPP as theirsecondary fraternal party within the Eastern Bloc alongside their Albaanlan
    comrades
    The CPP had a particularly problematic ap
    society that was not shared by the other Maoist organizations in the Soviet
    Bloc, namely their fierce nationalism. At times this nationalism manifestedin open antisemitism, with the party publishing pamphlets such as"The
    Participation of the Zionists in the Destruction of Polish Socialist Move-ment and Revisionists and Nationalist Jews in the Fight with the Polish
    Workers. While Mijal asserted later in life that his remarks were toward
    Zionists and not Jews in general, rhetoric such as"the Zionist-trotskyitegroup of Jewish nationalists, which, behind the mask of equality, desiresthe establishment of the rule of the Jewish national minority over the thir
    -million-strong Polish nation permeated the 1967 Programme of the
    Communist Party of Poland, making his defensive remarks somewhatdifficult to believe. 84 One must wonder why this was not criticized b

    Conclusion
    IINTERROGATING EISTORY AND THE MYTH OF MONOLITHIC MARXISM IN EASTERN EUROPE
    History is made in such a way that the final result always arises fromconflicts between many individual wills, of which each in turn has beenmade what it is by a host of particular conditions of life. Thus there areinnumerable intersecting forces, an infinite series of parallelograms offorces which give rise to one resultant: the historical event. This mayagain itself be viewed as the product of a power which works as a wholeunconsciously and without volition

    Where do things stand after examining the
    gle Maoist experiences in six
    countries and their relationship to the both broader Maoist experience inhe Global Sixties and mainstream understanding of dissent in the Soviet
    Bloc during the Cold War
    Almost all of my findings for this study have been discovered inhe margins: in government statements or documents, compilation textssmall passages within texts concerning broader aspects oof Soviet or hi-nese history, recently published journal articles, and in works that remainuntranslated into the English language. Despite this, a portrait can bepainted of people within the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe who heardhe Chinese anthem The East is Red, and, looking at their immediate
    Surroundin
    asked Which Eastisred': the Soviet Bloc East or East
    Asia? While the maiority of citizens of Eastern Bloc nations eked out apassive existence, oftentimes eschewing politics altogether, a few-spurredby the dual phenomena of economic reform and sidelining of hardlinecommunists-took a firm, vocal position and sald that their“East”wasnot re

    Western academic discourse
    Access to the voices of the dramatis personae in the Maoist storyis certainly difficult. Many archives continue to be shuttered to scholarsand the majority of those who took part in these events are either dead orliving out quiet, discreet twilight years with no involvement in politics orhistorical preservation. Still, as stated in my discussion of anti-revisionism in the Soviet Union, there is scholarship unfolding out there. Lengthynew articles by scholars such as Slobodian and Takacs demonstrate that
    English-language accounts of Eastern European Maoism are starting totrickle out. German and Russian scholars are starting to compile documents and periodicals pertaining to these movements and load them ontothe internet where they can be accessed easily by those who read their
    anguages
    This process needs to pick up speed, however. More scholars must bewilling to compile and translate these works and documents into English,and these efforts must be coordinated into a more coherent historiograshy. Mainstream academic discourse in the West concerning dissent inhe USSR and Soviet Bloc concentrates almost entirely on dissidents withpro-western, liberal-democratic views on how to fix the ills of their society
    e histories accessible tothe general public are the stories of men like
    Sakharov and Solzhenitsyn. Where is the history of those that fought sohard, often losing freedom and livelihood, to oppose the regimes withinheir respective nations with the message of communism? By publishing new histories of communist dissent in the Soviet Union and Eastern
    Europe, we can better understand the nuances of how social movements inthese countries unfolded on a transnational level and how people in thesecountries understood themselves in relation to the rest of the world at anexciting and dynamic point in history
