    The New Line of Red
    Guards Kansas City
    orm the Cadre Organization
    Whenever I find myself in a difficult situation I strive to look for its
    positive aspect or for what potential for development may still exist
    within that situation, because nothing is completely black, nor is
    anything completely red. Even if there were to be a big defeat, even
    though we have not had one yet, there would always be a positive aspect
    The point is to draw out the lessons, and continue to do our work based
    on the positive aspect. You will always find someone to support you, to
    lend their ardent enthusiasm and assistance to the struggle, because
    communism unites people
    -Presidente Gonzalo
    Historically all revolutionary movements started from mass struggles and
    mass organizations as well as struggles against a Rightist line. We can
    trace this historically with the Bolsheviks against the Mensheviks in the

==========第1页==========
    lead up to the October Socialist Revolution. The formation of the
    Communist Party of India (marxist-leninist)led by Charu Mazumdar, out
    of the Naxalbari uprising and from a split with Communist Party of India
    ( Marxist). The reconstitution of the Communist Party of the Philippines
    brought forth from the struggle against the Lava-taruc revisionists and
    from the First Quarter Storm. To the Revolutionary Union/Revolutionary
    Communist Party from SDS here in the US as well as the reconstitution of
    the Communist Party of Peru led by Chairman Gonzalo against the
    revisionist-reformists led by Saturnino Paredes
    At some point the Red Line had to formally consolidate and form a
    revolution party and from this party generate organizations that could be
    the vehicles for mass struggle. The explosion of mass activity
    necessitates a clarification and consolidation to sustain this momentum
    to a critical mass. At the same time the revolutionary line must contend
    with a revisionist one as well as a reformist counterrevolutionary line
    that also emerges from mass uprisings. At all levels the cadrefication of
    mass members should be the goal, replacing our numbers inside the
    mass org with mass members and eliminating the contradiction between
    cadre and the mass organization. Our past work aimed to win hearts and
    minds with political transformation as secondary. Our conception calls
    or concentric construction on a miniature scale. That everything flows
    from cadre and without initiation of this cadre there cannot be a true

==========第2页==========
    Maoist pole
    1. Start Your Maoist Collective with 3-5 members
    If you already have a consolidated core there is no reason why you
    cannot have a cadre organization. This necessitates democratic
    centralism in the formal sense as opposed to the informal sense. The
    cadre in the mass orgs should capture leadership in the mass
    organization by seeking to form a maximum and minimum number of 3
    cadre who will form a cell within the mass organizations, while still
    pholding that the Maoist organization must be composed of 3-5
    members initially. This cell forces the cadre organization to replace our
    ranks with mass members with as little overlap as possible. This cell must
    present written reports at cadre meetings to inform the cadre of politica
    work that is occurring in the mass organizations. The cell should be
    assigned to the mass organizations and their criteria as the most active
    members of this organization. They must also be initiators of all mass
    work within the organization and take a role of leadership
    A cell implies a unit with direct orders from the large cadre organization
    that operates through formal democratic centralism. The dangers of not
    replacing mass members with cadre is that cadre work, in turn, becomes
    secondary at best or at worst, and all work is done through the mass
    organizations. Thus, frontism becomes the practice of the Maoist

==========第3页==========
    organization in relation to its mass organization. When all cadre belong
    to the mass organizations there are no free hands available to carry
    about party building and the cadre work. Here overlap has seriously
    hampered the task of party building, ideological development and
    consolidation which should be the task of all Maoist collectives
    2. Generated Organism and Structure
    Their [the three instruments of revolution construction is guided by the
    principle that a just and correct ideological line decides everything, and it
    is on this ideologica-political basis that the organizationa construction is
    simultaneously developed in the midst of the struggle between the
    proletarian line and the bourgeois line and within the storm of the class
    struggle
    On Marxism-leninism-maoism, Communist Party of Peru
    Once the cadre have been united in a stable organization, and have
    committed to carrying out mass work, the construction of a mass
    organization should begin immediately. The mass organization thus
    becomes a"generated organism"meaning that it is initiated by cadre
    This serves the basic twofold task of organizing the masses to bring them
    into open conflict with the class enemy and training the masses in
    administration. Through generated organisms we organize the

==========第4页==========
    disorganized masses for the struggle against the organized power of the
    ruling class
    The cadre cell generating the organization ensures that the correct
    ideological line forms the basis for the organization. Viewing the mass
    organization as a primarily multi-tendency organization, which had an
    informal Maoist hegemony is a mistake. This forms a tenuous situation,
    which rests more so on the numerous Maoists inside the organization
    exerting pressure on members to transform politically rather than
    Maoism being the political orientation of the organization in general. The
    result of this is not only that oppositional political trends can grow and
    gain a significant foothold in the organization without violating any
    organizational documents or discipline, but also that it undermines the
    work of cadre in creating new communists by fostering
    non-revolutionary and eclectic political orientations that seek to com
    Maoism internally. This is an especially dangerous situation in the initia
    stages of the organization, for if the Maoists do not gain a foothold and
    conquer ideological hegemony, which is merely informal, then the
    organization rests on an incorrect ideological line and its political work

==========第5页==========
    Marxism-leninism-maoism in a formal manner, stamping out the
    eclecticism of the multi-tendency approach and replacing it with a
    formal Maoist oriented mass organization. This is of the utmost necessity
    or our work, of which the end goal of conquering power is our primary
    aim, of which the question of proletarian political power in Maoism is of
    undamental importance. If we are serious in our work of building
    towards that goal then we must develop the masses politically to that
    goal through Maoism. This cannot be accomplished through wading
    through the mire of ideological-political eclecticism, and we should be
    open and honest in our desire to steel and develop the masses through
    these generated organisms in Marxism-leninism-maoism
    It would be a mistake to give one inch to consensus democracy as the
    basis for the structure of the organization. This is a rightist conception of
    an organization that is to be a fighting organization of the masses, and a
    practice that is foreign to Maoism, but right at home in the movementist
    Left in its various anarchist social-democratic. and revisionist formations
    In promoting this one succumbs to"ultra-democracy"(where individuals
    are free to subvert organizational discipline, and this in turn actually
    negates the democracy that it seeks to promote)and horizontalism in
    that ones Maoist core is actually negated on several cases because
    centralism is not present from the beginning. This can hamper ones
    ability to carry out tasks and actually increased the amount of time

==========第6页==========
    wasted on meetings and deliberation rather than expediting it. In
    ssence, one is not only negating democracy but also centralism as well
    Ultra-democracy and horizontalism negate leadership, in theory as being
    in authoritarianimposition, and in practice by bogging the
    organization down through a lack of fidelity to discipline and collectivism
    to where even informal leadership becomes ineffective
    In the storm of the class struggle, leaders and leadership, are produced
    As communists we understand this not as an evil to be combatted but a
    necessity that we should not shy away from recognizing, steeling, and
    developing. To negate the necessity for leadership erases all pretenses of
    democratic centralism, and negates genuine proletarian leadership, and
    thus the necessity for the Communist Party itself. A weak leadership
    even from the beginning, means an ineffective organization. The
    corrective is to implement democratic centralism in the mass
    organization, so the lower bodies(general membership )are subordinate
    to the higher bodies(secretariat). The formulation of democratic
    centralism should not be mistaken for democracy being primary(and
    indeed this was our previous error)but rather, that centralism is primary
    Democracy is merely the base, or the road, by which we arrive at
    centralism
    Numbers do not negate democratic centralism. Even when the

==========第7页==========
    organization is under 10 members the organization should operate along
    democratic centralist lines to both establish a proper Maoist culture and
    discipline, and to also foster effective leadership and participation from
    general membership. During this stage the cell should formally assume
    the role of the secretariat of the organization. The secretariat should
    never be more or less than 3 positions (Chairperson, General-secretary
    and Education Officer)no matter how large the organization grows. The
    work of leading and maintaining an organization should be able to be
    carried out by three individuals as long as the secretariat initiates
    committees and/or tasks mass members to carry out tasks, which are
    binding, and the cell is vocal in pushing a revolutionary line of action and
    ideas openly. In the event that the organization grows but then regresses
    to 10 or less members, the cell must again assume all leadership
    The cell should work to overcome specialization in organizational work
    We should not discourage an individual doing a lot of tasks, but we
    should not let that person become overburdened or allow other cell
    members to shirk their responsibilities. Leadership is collective, not
    individua
    3. ldentify a Fixed Site of Struggle to Recruit From
    We initially recruited from a local university(a fixed site of struggle
    among a club within that university(a fixed community)who were

==========第8页==========
    already familiar with radical political ideas. They formed a consistent
    core within our mass work early on. We also recruited from students
    studying in the humanities, as they too were also familiar wi
    progressive and radical ideas. We challenged these sections to put their
    ideas into practice
    By focusing on a fixed site of struggle with a substantial, stable, and
    consistent concentration of people we were assuring that our presence
    as a group was established and strenthened. This allowed for a
    concentrated organizing base area as opposed to a more diffuse area of
    organizing in the city in general. By focusing on a fixed community within
    a fixed site of struggle and propagating revolutionary politics to
    sympathetic people, but also challenging them to put ideas into practice,
    We were thus able to form ourselves as well as integrate ourselves into
    struggle on campus, as the club' s members also interact with members
    from the student body in general
    4. ldentify The"Leaders
    It is important to identify and win over the leaders in the particular
    community you are working in. The revolutionaries must take advantage
    of recruiting from fixed sites of struggle from fixed communities by
    winning over their leaders, who will in turn recruit and mobilize from
    within those same communities. This is a universal truth in many

==========第9页==========
    peoples wars in which a village is won over by winning over the village
    elder or tribal leader. By winning over the leaders we switch from
    recruitment on an individual basis to recruiting on a more mass basis
    5. Organizational Procedure
    All meetings must be purposeful. It is not productive to hold meetings
    for the sake of holding meetings if no real work is being accomplished
    Members should also be expected to be familiar with organizational
    documents, as new member orientations should cover all relevan
    documents, and members are expected to remain familiar with these
    and uphold them as long as they retain membership in the organization
    In the beginning points of unity are sufficient as they unite and draw in a
    broad base of people from the recruiting site/section, but once the
    organization grows and develops over 10 people the immediate goal is to
    develop a political line for the organization to replace them
    Points of unity reflect a lower level of political development and only
    loosely bind members ideologically around broad core principles(e.g
    anti-imperialism, anti-racism, socialism etc. ). This is unfitting if an
    organization seeks to reach the masses on a large scale as these will be
    seen as idealistic fantasies in the absence of a political line. Depending
    on the organization the political line may differ but it should be borne
    out of the mass work the organization is conducting, from its own

==========第10页==========
    investigation and its own political experiences
    The cells should report, in a written fashion, to the cadre formation their
    political work inside the mass organization and any relevant updates at
    each meeting. This keeps all cadre informed to the goings on of the mass
    organization, and can also help identify mass members politically and
    ideologically developed enough to be moved up to cadre
    6. Hold Regular Collective Studies and Collect Mandatory Dues
    Regular collective studies are a mandatory part of the mass org. Since
    mass orgs are initiated by the Maoist political line, mass or members
    must undergo the political transformation of learning the thought
    behind its existence and applying this line in their political work. Regular
    studies ensure a measurable standard to grow the organization
    ideologically
    Monthly dues are mandatory and must be seen as a necessary part of
    maintaining the printing of flyers as well as other materials necessary for
    outreach or propaganda. Dues should be a fixed minimum amount and
    members should be allowed to give more but not less. If a member is
    unable to contribute the minimum amount, assign them one or two
    additional tasks per month, but only on a case by case scenario. The
    treasurer should keep track of who is paying, and discipline should be

==========第11页==========
    applied by the Secretariat in the case of members neglecting this duty
    The collection of dues in a democratic organization also ensures a sort of
    personal investment in the organization. Dues used to be voluntary due
    to concerns about alienating members that are not able to pay. However,
    we abolished the voluntary dues line because it was liberal. Mandatory
    dues encourage a higher level of investment within membership. We
    also uphold this line because we value quality over guantity and believe
    that truly dedicated members will contribute to the material needs of
    their organization
    True believers in revolution have been willing to become martyrs for
    liberation, a few dollars would be nothing for them if they were truly
    Invested In proletarian revolution.
    In revolutionary collective studies we demarcate between libera
    ideology and tactics with militant ones, with the latter meant to raise the
    overall ideological level among mass members and the population they
    organize with. Education is centralized within the secretariat so that
    liberal and erroneous ideas do not take a hold in the mass organization
    and when they are encountered they must be struggled with through a
    process of criticism and tying back to the political line of the mass org
    7. Build Up an Authentic Maoist Culture

==========第12页==========
    Authentic Maoist culture fosters a strictly political culture as well as a
    normalization and regular practice of principled criticism and
    self-criticism. We must foster a culture of solidarity, serving the people
    and serving comrades but politics must be in command
    Here we must also utilize a stance that there can be no"long breaks"fo
    cadre and mass members in our organization, so long as they wish to
    remain inside the organization. We must also follow organizationa
    discipline and always outwardly promote the Maoist political line within
    the mass org. Every member must feel free to express their criticisms
    taking caution never to blunt criticism, but to also engage in a principled
    manner with the essence of the criticism taking precedence
    Revisionism and liberalism should be openly challenged right then and
    there, not allowed to fester as non-antagonistic contradictions will be
    allowed to deepen and will erupt antagonistically Belonging to a politica
    organization should take precedence over liberal notions of friendship
    over politics
    8. Stay Organized
    It is important to establish a calendar and always take notes in meetings
    and to review them. Encourage members to do this and enforce it if
    need be. Every printed agenda should contain events for that month

==========第13页==========
    with important dates at the end. Establishing some discipline is good in
    the organization. After events, summarize them as soon as possible
    typically the next regular meeting or if you can immediately after
    eadership cannot be expected to know everything just off the top of
    their head. By forming a calendar it allows one to plan events ahead. B
    keeping in mind important dates(or as the Filipino Revolutionaries call
    themed Letter Dates)such as May Day, International Working
    Women s Day, organization anniversaries etc. a month or a few months
    ahead of time, the organization is not caught planning things as they
    come. Similarly, by expecting members to also keep calendars, take notes
    etc. it prepares them to also take up roles of leadership when the time
    comes
    9. Do Not Orient Towards The Left
    eft unity does not build a Maoist movement, but instead dilutes the
    possibility for more militant organizing. We have observed this in our
    own work, whether working with anarchistorganizations "like Food Not
    Bombs, IWW. or the Democratic Socialists of America. For instance
    when we contacted other organizations to show up in mass for the
    protest to the fascist anti-sharia law march, DSA and other libera
    organizations split off to occupy another portion of the park to give
    speeches, testimonials, and talk to the media, whereas our mass

==========第14页==========
    organizations stayed put and directed our attention directly at the fasci
    rather than"ignoring them
    The splitting represents an ideological antagonism, as it is an
    appeasement to the crushing brutality of fascism, for the sake of peace
    and" being the bigger person. Such left unity falls into the error of
    tailing and opportunism, an anti-communist idea. We can see this error
    in our own work, as left unity incentivizes ideological concessions for the
    hope that such favors will be returned in the future and we build mass
    support via uncritical tailing of the"masses.When it was rumored ICE
    was going to be doing raids in Kansas City, a call was made by
    Kansas/Missouri DREAM Alliance to bring out people to do patrols. The
    call was made at midnight and participants were to report to the
    Hispanic Chamber of Commerce at 6 am. 40 people volunteered that day
    with over half comprising of our mass organization members. Those who
    did not always agree With us repeatedly remarked positively to the
    showing up, consistency and discipline of mass members
    Although we comprised over half of the individuals who had responded
    to the call, and although we were amongst the few willing to forciblystop any detainment observed, our tailing of organizations like KSMODA
    did not result in favors being returned, but in fact limited our own work
    When we attempted to organize a sit-in at a local community college in

==========第15页==========
    response to raising rates for undocumented students, KSMODA dropped
    out of attendance a few days prior, citing they were uneasy with our
    methods, as they were too"militant
    When criticized for breaking their commitment, they took principled
    criticism as a personal attack and responded hostilely, severing all
    communications, although our members had been integral in
    volunteering for their DACA clinics, even when their own members could
    or would not. This again exposes a set of inherent contradictions, namely,
    how does an organization with the intent of creating Maoists organize
    alongside organizations who actively reject Maoist principles, why take
    up faulty alliances that dilute our political line when we still serve as the
    most devoted to the work, and how can aunified left"agitate the
    masses, when such approaches are antagonistic to one another. The end
    point of left unity then falls into the logical conclusion of tailing
    opportunism, and revisionism. The highest example of this was our
    membership"in the Kansas City Grass Roots Network, an assortment of
    garden variety leftists led chiefly by the DSA, the KC Green Party, and
    local anarchists, in preparation of the ACT for America sponsored white
    supremacist rallies on 9/9. Again, our resolve for membership was
    rightist in form, as it put concessionary alliances for broad left support
    over Maoist politics in command for mass support. All preparations for
    the event, including propaganda, flyering, and even bodies on the

==========第16页==========
    ground ready to confront the fascists fell solely on our shoulders
    although the KC- GRN sought to take credit for the action
    Our reliance on their goodwill led only to missed opportunities to fully
    commit ourselves to agitating amongst the working class of Kansas City
    Such alliance s as the KC -GRN even harbored known wreckers and
    abusers, with no means to discipline or rectify their behavior, due to
    their garden variety ideologies and their inherent horizontalism. To forge
    such alliances with anti-maoist elements s to allow liberalism and
    revisionism to permeate into our work. For these reasons, we denounce
    left unity, and will forge no alliances nor work alongside any
    organization that opposes our political line. We welcome those who
    support our political line, and forge alliances only with those who
    actively take up that political line. As Maoist, we must win over the
    masses. We cannot be won over by theleft
    10. Do Not Engage in Unprincipled Attacks and Squabbles
    Principled criticisms are encouraged over petty and persona
    disagreements. In our attempts to remain above the bullshit, we
    sometimes erred on the side of allowing incorrect lines to go
    unchallenged to avoid arguments. We attempted to ignore and run from
    contradictions that arose both from within and from our relationships
    with other organizations, in the hope that they would resolve

==========第17页==========
    themselves
    In both our handling of the post-modern clique and of the divide
    between us and the STL revisionists, we chose unprincipled peace over
    struggle. But, failure to resolve these contradictions was inevitable due
    to our approach. We must remain principled in our debates so that we
    can be understood, but we should not shy away from open struggle
    Reactionary ideas will continue to thrive unless we attack them directl
    We should not mistake valid criticism for unnecessary squabbling and
    the essence of an argument takes precedence over its form or
    perceived "form. With a political criticism we can make no concession in
    seeing out two-line struggle until the end
    11. Build the National Organizing Committee
    Is we see in the world, Maoism is marching unstoppably to lead the
    new wave of world proletarian revolution. Listen well and understand!
    Those who have ears, use them. Those who have understanding-and
    we all have it -use it! Enough of this nonsense. Enough of theseobscurities! Let us understand that! What is unfolding in the world?
    What do we need? We need Maoism to be incarnated, and it is being
    incarnated, and by generating Communist Parties to drive and lead this
    new great wave of the world proletarian revolution that is coming
    Everything they told us, the empty and silly chatter of the famous new

==========第18页==========
    age of peace. "Where is it now 2
    Presidente Gonzalo
    All existing and new Maoist political collectives must place the question
    of the Party as primary and incorporate mass work into the creation of
    this party through a formal process via the pre-party formation. After the
    colla pse LC, many collectives including our own, advocated for the
    Autonomous Maoist Collective model, pushing the thought of party
    building to an undetermined future time. The LC'S bad political lines and
    the backwards culture it curated understandably left a bad taste in the
    mouth of US Maoists. Subsequently, many collectives took up the task of
    building up"locally instead of a true party-building effort. This position
    las hindered collectives ability to unite wholly, and our unity is only
    based on our commitment to Maoism, but this approach lacks any way
    to facilitate true line struggle
    Individuals and collectives have no real accountability to each other and
    in the past, this has turned attempts at line struggle into persona
    conflict, and outright ridicule. As the US MLM movement grows,
    potential new collectives could be forced to choose which of the existing
    collectives to align with should these current alliances dissolve, and this
    could fracture the modern MLM movement much like thecommunist
    movements in the US before it. This position also leaves these collectives

==========第19页==========
    susceptible to collapse, as they have no larger system of support to help
    them weather the ebbs and flows of revolutionary work, regardless of
    their political line. This pre-party formation would assist in helping new
    MLM collectives to form, and a pole in which autonomous MLM
    collectives spring up can gravitate towards. It would seek to consolidate
    those collectives through ideological struggle, set some standards at
    what constitutes mass work, coordinate where to concentrate resources
    to work, generate mass organizations and help existing mass
    organizations consolidate, the STPS for example, initiate resources and
    concentration to penetrate the labor movement etc.
    To further our unity and advance the revolutionary situation in the US
    now more than ever it is necessary to take up the task of building a
    Maoist party, beginning with furthering the principled unity that weve
    established with collectives of dedicated Maoists across the US. We
    cannot begin to seriously discuss peoples war or how to take advantage
    of the impending capitalist wars without the formation of a party, which
    is why we fully support the beginning of the construction of a Maoist
    pre-party formation. Weve continued this process with the MCLS 2018
    as we all seek to develop ideologically and further unite the US Maoist
    movement. A pre-party formation could unite the political lines of the
    current MLM movement, guide new collectives in their formation, and
    create a nationally united MLM movement as we build towards

    revolution in the US
    We are at a point in history where it is very likely that a World War could
    happen within the next 5-10 years, the international bourgeoisie has
    expanded rapaciously across the globe with the dissolution of phony
    Communism and the imperialist powers that have emerged are in
    competition for global influence and markets. What exists now in the
    United States is one that can be called Cold Civil War that could very well
    become hot. What separates us from the other revisionist parties is the
    question of Peoples War, this is how we will resist the Empire. ALL mass
    work that is conducted and initiated by the Party Will be tailored to
    constructing the capacity to wage Peoples War. This can only be possible
    through the construction of the Party with the current Maoist collectives
    congealing and forming a pole
