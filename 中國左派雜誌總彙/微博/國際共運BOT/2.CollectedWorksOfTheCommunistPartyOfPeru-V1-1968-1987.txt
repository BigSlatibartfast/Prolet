    PUBLISHERS PREFACE
    Dear comrades
    Fromthe very beginning of the history of the Communist Parof Peru ( PCP), an effort was being done by
    our Peruvian
    comrades living abroad to translate and spread words of the
    Chairman Gonzalo. But those works, being usually available inhard to get small pamphlets, have never been fully collected andprinted in volumes of full works. Luis Arce Borja from El Diario
    Internacional published in 1989 and 1994 two volumes in Spanishunder the name"Guerra Popular en el Peru, El Pensamiento
    Gonzalo", that tried to collected the more important works ofPCP. But a lot of crucial deocuments
    e nterview o
    Chairman Gonzalo, were missing from those volumes
    This is why the publication of this first edition of collected (andnot"full "as we are aware of the shortcomings of this publication)
    works of PCP is a speecial occasion. It's the first time in histor
    lat an edition, as complete as possible, was compiled, translatedth
    where it was necessary, and was published in a series of fourvolumes, going from the beginning of PCP(1968)to the captureof Comrade Feliciano (1999)
    This publication of the Collected Works of the PCP shows thenecessity for all the communists and revolutionaries in the worldto put Marxism-leninism-maoism into practice, and to study
    onzain
    tought, that is the creative application of Marxism
    Leninism-maoism in Peru, and is, so far, the greatest attempt todevelop the fourth stage of Marxism
    We don't pretend that this edition incorporates all the documentsof PCP, even if it was our goal. It is obvious that some of the
    7

    statements, leaflets or books could have been lost in the tumult othe peoples war. It is also hard to trust some documents releasedby fractions of the old PCP that are known for forging fake lettersand statments for their own benefit
    We decided to conserve the smalll modification that weve done tosome texts in the compilation"CPP and Mao Tsetung in 1987
    But if some of the comrades possess some documents that wedon't, we would be glad to print them in another edition of these
    collected works

    TO UNDERSTTAND MARIATEGUI
    CONFERENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN CRISTOBAL DE HUAMANGAIN AYACUCHO, PERU, 1968
    It has been a little more than threeyeears Since we haoccasion to talk from this place. At the time, we spoke about theproblem of education and shared ourthoughts on this important
    Issue
    was a wonderful opportunity to talk with
    Toda
    once again, we have the opportunity to speak with you, but thecircumstances are somewhat different
    We are going to speak about Jose Carlos Mariategui, of theactuality of his thought, and this task which I have been assignedto address, is not in itself an easy task, at least not to me. First ofall, we believe that Mariategui must be approached with respectand secondly, we must approach hiIm from a clear and preciseosition, because otherwise it is not possible in any way tounderstand the actuality and richness of his thought
    Of course, Mariategui has been physically dead for many years,but his thought is still
    g
    profoundly alive, just as it was in the 1930s
    It is still vibrant, still current and still a perspective for Pert, whileother thoughts of people who are still alive are truly dead
    It is difficult in an hour more or less, to talk on all Mariatthought, so for this reason we want to focus on a few concreteproblems and emphasize on what should do facing the image ofthis great Peruvian. First, we uphold the figure of Mariategui as aproletarian intellectual
    e will not get into detailed dates or
    other matters which are not of interest now. We will get intocentral problems set forth by the actuality of the thought of Jose
    Carlos Mariategui

    COLLECTED WORKS OF PCP-VOLUME 1(1968-1987TO UNDERSTAND MARIATEGUI
    After having tried to bury him in silence, much has been writtenabout Mariategui. Of course, we also see Mariategui as very highlyspoken of, so as to mystify him, to systematically try to twist him,to try to "better him with senseless pedantry. It haas been said Inthe first place about Mariategui that he was not a convicted andconfessed Marxist and whose thought was not sustained b
    Marxism-leninism
    Mariategui said it himself. He was a convicted and confessed
    Marxist, fearless, neat and precise. What does that mean? It meansthat Mariategui had a proletarian class position. He was plainly
    and Simaply on the side of the exploited. Mariategui felt in his own
    flesh what the exploited masses of our country felt and during histime, unfortunately for us, a very short life, he translated intodeeds what he felt and put in practice written word. Mariategui
    ad a conception oof the world. He had an ideology, and he said
    many times that his ideology was Marxism-leninism. Heconceived and upheld it, and he based his thesis oncontemporary world. It is not possible to understand things, and itis not possible to understand society and the world,unless weview them from the ideological conception of the proletariat
    Mariategui was a Marxist-leninist. If we review his works
    Mariategui tells us that in the current century (he spoke aroundthe 1920s) Leninism was the new form, the highest Marxismacquired at the time. Mariategui then found his affiliation with
    Marx and Lenin and that is why he called himself a convicted andconfessed Marxist-leninist. In the third place, Mariategui had aworking method, a method of analysis, an irreplaceable method tounderstand anything. Mariategui based himself on dialecticalmaterialism. and hs works are convincing proof o
    f of that. The first

    him and the dialectical materialistic method guiding him ou. Rgquestion, we said, which must be very clear, is the prol
    arian
    position of Mariategui, the Marxist-leninist ideology no
    shing
    On these three bases it is feasible to understand the figure of Jose
    Carlos Mariategui, but whoever cannot understand Marxism
    Leninism, will not be able to understand Mariategui, and it is nottor a lack of enlightening or of intelligence that she or he cannotunderstand him. but because he is not on the same side. nor has
    e same 1Ght in the brain, nor uses the same method, That must
    g
    be veryclear
    We must base ourselves on facts, start from the class position of
    Mariategui, start from his Marxist-leninist ideology and one mustalso start, theerefore
    om
    his dialectical materialist method
    Whoever does not focus on Mariategui with those threeviewpoints indicated above, cannot understand his thought andwill twist it in many cases in good faith or in the majority of caseslike the feathery hacks, in very bad faith
    Mariategui was a great Latin American Marxist-leninist and wemust be very proud of that fact. There is not in all of LatinAmerica another Marxist-leninist comparable to him in any waytruly Jose Carlos Mariategui is a summit of Latin-american
    Marxism thought and a greater summit as time goes on
    Jose Carlos Mariategui is better appreciated outside our borders
    Here in our country he is less wanted, less respected, and evenvery little known, which is a shame. Mariategui then is a great
    Marxist-leninist, who honors our country and the exploitedamong our people, but not others, for the others hee is a knsunk in their hearts, which they cannot manage to take it outneither will they are able to take it out

    Mariategui was not a mere repeater, who simply knew four or fiveformulas, but he is much more, something more profound, more
    Marxist. He takes Marxism-leninism and introduces and fuses itwith our reality, he gets it into our country, incarnates it in oursoil, and upon incarnating it, introducing it, penetrating it in ourcountry with Marxism-leninism, he Illuminates us with a thoughtwhich is still current. The interpretation Mariategui wrote of ourcountry, in his famous"Seven Interpretative Essays on Peruvian
    Reality, (Siete Ensayos de Interpretacion de la Realidad Peruana)is still an unshakable document
    In Mariategui we see the grip he had, the Marxist and genial gripof being able to fuse the universal reality of Marxism-leninismith the concrete actuality of our revolutionary prophet. Very fewpersons have this quality and Mariategui had it in excess andgrandeur, anend we must recognize it. Whoever does notunderstand the development of Marxist ideas in our countcannot understand what is happening in Peru, and evens less, ofcourse, can he call himself a revolutionary? Untortunately theremany revolutionaries out there who know Mariategui's thoughtand still fear it, a justified fear, because it is a good touching stoneto find out who are genuine revolutionaries and who are not
    That s the reason why they fear Mariategui. Mariategui's Seven
    Essays are still a fundamental part of Peruvian thought
    Mariategui developed seven masterful interpretations for us fromthe Marxist viewpoint, and from the one and only correctviewpoint of our Peruvian reality. Many talented and well-versedscholars with a contrary viewpoint have tried to discredit that littleook, from the reactionary position of Don Victor Arnares
    Belaunde(TNF: Bourgeois Peruvian Historian), but their efforts

    TO UNDERSTAND MARIATEGU
    Mariategui's little book "Seven Interpretative Essays on Peruvian
    Reality is still very much alive, while that of Don Victor Andres
    Belaunde has been read only by very few (mostly for historicalcuriosity. )We must start from this, what Mariategui is telling usin that little book, in this small volume which constitutes a visionf the People s War in our country. Mariategui does an analysis of
    our economny, which is a vital and fundamental issue. It is
    impossible to understand a society if we don't understand itseconomic structure, unless we understand the social relations ofexploitation which are the social economy, the political economyelse are fabrications(TNE: Spanish word engendros). Whatdoes he tell us about Peri? He characterized it very concretely
    Peru is a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country. He shows androves it in his scheme of the economic process of our countPMariategui also develops an outline of social classes in Peru and
    their historical development, and he states, with other words, ofwhat today is the Marxist thought in Perd being developed unde
    Mao Tsetung's thought
    Mariategui not only develops an outline of the relations ofexploitation in our country, not just an outline of the socialclasses. he also makes a schematic that describes the evolution ofideas in Perd. He speaks, for instance, of the literalry problemsomething we must study sufficiently to realize how literature hasevolved in Pert, and how it has had a clear class character
    Mariategui makes a fusion of Marxism-leninism with the concreterea
    ot our country, and as a result, the best, the most profound
    meaning oof that reality emerges. This analysis of the Peruvian
    reality is the basis to continue advancing theoretically whaat hemasterfully began. No one was able to seriously refute ththeoretical thesis of Mariategui, the most they could
    s t
    come up with superficial outlines, but they could not make thebuilding that he designed and built so quickly and at such a

    young age.
    Much has been said that the Seven Essays, was simjournalistic work, Putting them down as only the work ofnewspaperman. There is even a certain individual-the meresaying of his name, Ravines [TNFusurped
    e Partv s leadershi
    after Mariategui's dead], pollutes the air around us-he claiminthings like this: what can onethink about Mariategui, why soluch noise about Mariategui if he was onl
    lvo ous
    journalist. That person did not understand a bit about
    Mariategui; of course, how could he understand anything about
    Mariategui, when he was one of those who deviated from
    Mariategui's road (iust like a player of a team who takes off hishirt and goes over to help the other side. )Because they lack theroletarian conception and the method of Mariategui, that shirtwill not help them. With time and exposure to the sunlighthings lose their color and become yellowish
    For this reason, the problem is not external, but three little things,three basic things about Mariategui; his class position,ideology and his method. Whoever is on the side of theproletariat, of the peasantry and of the exploited classes in ourcountry is in a position to understand Mariategui; whoever doesnot assume this attitude. this class position, whoever has one foot
    on
    the side of the exploited, and the other foot on the side of theexploiters, whoever cautiously sides with the exploited, but atheart is with the exploiters, is not able to understand Mariateguithats why we see so many salivating varmints out there. However,their spit will never reach the height of the steps reached b

    as a proletarian fighter, a great figure, an extraordinary thinkerand also an extraordinary organizer, and the first militant Marxistfighter of our country. We must also put that out very clearly
    Jose Carlos Mariategui came to our country from Europe. Hebrought new ideas and a new task, a mission: to build socialism in
    Peru. That was his mission and he fulfilled it. He worked tirelessfor socialism. he lived for socialism, he outstretched himself forsocialism. and he died for socialism. At all times he remainedunbeatable, with an erect spinal cord, without twistingaccommodations. When one studies a bit, one finds in Mariateguia work plan, some kind of organizational development of thproletariat in our country. In the first place, he works to preparethe work of workers unions, he shows up as one of the creators ofclassic trade unionism. Before him there already were unionstruggles in thee country, but Maariategui sets the bases tor
    Proletarian industrial unionism. Mariategui is the founder of the
    General Confederation of Peruvian Workers(CGTP). The CGTPis Mariategui's work He was its ideologist, its mentor, who builtlt organica
    and who conceived its foundations and
    organizational characters
    One of the first organizations the proletariat needs is thestructuring of an industrial and trade Central Union. Mariateguiunderstood that very well, but he not only understood it, since
    Mariategui was not the type of person who upon understanding
    someething, just laid back relaxing on the enjoyment of
    IS OW
    lucidity, but quite the contrary, he felt the need to fulfill the taskthis understanding demanded of him. He did all the preparatowork of the CGTP constitution and platform. Any constitution,no matter what it is, has two consecutive parts, two elementswhich together form any organization or institution. First, the
    15

==========第15页==========
    COLLECTED WORKS OF PCP-VOLUME 1(1968-1987
    ideological part, that is, the dynamics of thought, the formation ofa programme, the constitution of its points of agreement, theimportance of a statute, etc, and a second part, the constitution ofthe organization apparatus strictly speaking. That was understoodby Mariategui profoundly and masterfully, and following his
    Marxist analysis, Mariategui was the creator of the CGTP
    THE GENERAL CONFEDERATON OF PERUVANWORKERS (CGTP
    There is a very interesting thing: in developing the statutes
    Mariategui made a class conscientious, proletarian workers'union
    ironic, but more than ironic, it is proof 0/6 +ealization. That isstatute which is still awaiting to fulfill its
    e disorientation and
    confusion that after him have imposed certain individuals in theworkers union movement in our country. If you read the CGTPstatutes, in the first place vou'd find some sort of introduction, anorientation says Mariategui, and it set forth how the proletariatsees the world of today, how there is a struggle which cannot bedisguised a struggle which cannot be swept under the rag,struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and in turnhe sets forth, that there is a class ideology one must follow tocreate a union organization, he sets it forth clearly and in a verrecise language. Then, what does Mariategui do?
    P
    f that 'Sui sets forth the general bases of the organic constitution
    of that union organization, but he does not do it so meticulously
    as to suffocate it, but in general lines, and basic points which
    allow for the development and initiative of the people. We cannottell the people, " when you get down a ladder, do it first with theright foot. We must allow for their initiative, their creativity, letthem think with their own heads so they can understand the

    of guiding dog, because the people arent blind. Mariateguiunderstood that very well and thats why he drew the generalbases for the organization. Also, when Mariategui addressed theproblem of the unions he referred to formidable ideas not foundin any statute. The only favorable difterence of todays statutes isthat they are printed in a better quality paper
    Mariategui sets forth the means of the struggle and speaks to usabout the strike. Why does Mariategui set forth things that way
    Because in the organization one must also speak to them of themeans and tactics to wage a struggle, in accordance with what wewant to achieve. there is a form of thele struggle
    It is important to sany this, because it one reads thee newspapers otoday in our country, La Prensa, for instance, it claims that thestrike is a poor method, inadequate, a method just for extremistagitators. La Prensa wants to domesticate the proletariat wishing it
    never
    goes on strike, but rather appeal to Congressparliamentarism), to compromise, it pretends that the victim oftheft discusses about the stoleng
    e
    ief. In any
    struggle, it is important, it is fundamental, to see what the meanssf thele struggle 1S, the ways In which struggle 1s conducted, andhat is the basic and fundamental demand that allows themobilization of the masses, and mobilizing them for onesacrosanct reason: because through active mobilization the peopleopen their eyes and understand and freetheemselves from apathand atavism andgo on to generate those who will conduct thestruggles ( their leaders). For this reason, a mass movement is veryimportant, for that reason its good to highlight th
    g
    is fundamental
    point in thele statutes of the CGTP. Mariategui also addresses the
    rodem of propaganda and agitation. The people need their own
    P
    voice to say their own words. They don't need for others to say itinstead of them. The people may not talk in a floridanguage,they may not have a polished language, they might make mistakes

    on diction, but it does not matter. What counts is that the peoplesay what they feel, what they see, what they need and struggleconsistently and to the end for what they want, regardless ofdefeats, because any defeats the people may suffer are temporary,all of them, each and every one of them; Mariategui takes care ofthat too and when we read the statutes he speaks ofPropagandaand agitation
    If we study at this long historical period from Mariategui's death,we see how this entire problem has not been understood and howreaction may shout at us every day. However, we cannot find adaily press expressing the voice of the workers, we can't find sucha thing because the problem, how Mariategui set it forth, hasnever been well understood. If we do this small summary of whatwas proposed right inthe statutes of the CGTP. then we see theextraordinary capacity Mariategui possessed and

    THE ORGANATION OF THE PEASANTRY
    Mariategui proposes that the people, first and foremost, mustdefine their ideological and political position, second, they mustorge their organic structure
    But Mariategui not onytakes care of organizing thee workers, thegigantic work of Mariategui does not end there, but he sees
    Somethin
    else: he understands our country to its verryentrails
    and discovers that in our country there are peasants. Mariateguinot only studies them but understands their role, understandstheelr
    historic mission, and what it is that oppresses them18

==========第18页==========
    TO UNDERSTAND MARIATEGU
    Mariategui says that in Perd, there are peasants who are crushedby the feudalism oppressing them. This feudalism has twoexpressions: Latifundia and serfdom that damned urge to exploitto live off somebody elses labor. Mariategui understands all thatand pinpoints the fundamental cause, the malady, the origin, thehistoric source is feudalism which still prevails in our country. Hesays our country is semi-feudal and, that is a mountain yielding itsweight over and crushing the Peruvian peasant. The problem ofne Peruvian peasant is the problem of the land, and the prremof the land is summarized by how to conquer that land. How canthe land be conquered? Mariategui proposes that the peasantry be
    organized a hqt" the first to sow it under a correct concept, to
    ight for it from a proletarian viewpoint, indefatigable in theorganization of peasants. Mariategui has a profound work that isseldom read, because many consider it simple political work ratherthan a scientific one. Some people have monumental blindness
    Mariategui begins to address the peasants problem and proposesorganic forms, and he does an analysis in his work"Setch of the
    Indigenous Problem, "which was presented at an internationalmeeting
    Mariategui analyzes the situation of the peasantry in our countrof interest to us is that right theere he proposes torms to organizethe peasantry. Mariategui calls for organizing unions of peasantsto form peasant leagues, to set forth organizations capable ofmobilizing of the peasantry. Mariategui understands that withoutorganization the people are very weak and cannot fight. However,
    he does not stop there, he proposes the need to create a workers
    peasants alliance, that is, one of the most fundamental principalsof any revolutionary process
    Mariategui points this out and goes further. He proposes twoextraordinary things; with respect to Power, Lenin said: theroblem of the revolution is the problem of Power. That is

    fundamenta, everything points to conquering power, to retain itor to maintain it. Some believe that Mariategui was a deformedhumanist or a humanistic bourgeois liberal. Mariategui goes muchfurther and says that there is something else to do in the problemof organizing the peasantry: to tind out the weaponry of thepeasants, to organize the revolutionary armed forces of the
    spelt a-. Now, don,'t tell me I am promoting this: I am mered.of Mariategui, and Mariategui

    Peasantryas one of thele necessary forms of organizing them, henot only proposed that, but proposed that Soviets needed to beformed, and that is most correct and applicable from A to Z,wholly and absolutely, outside little fears we might have. That washow Mariategui proposed things
    THE PARTY
    Mariategui resolves the political problem in our country. Heknows perfectly well that the proletariat has organic forms such asworkers unions, workers'alliances, and workers' weaponry. Well,
    Mariategui knew that these three things we iust mentionedamount to nothing if there is no brain guiding it. So then
    Mariategul PIrodoses founding a proletarian party and creates thea
    f the proletariat in our country. Anlyon studying
    problem of the ideas in Peru must recognize that fact. But outthere we see some of the ilk of Carlos Tapia TNF: thee sameindividual who nowadays-1990- is a well-paid Senderologist, anagent of reaction] saying that Mariategui was not the founder ofthe Communist Party of Perd, that what Mariategui founded wasthe Socialist Party of Peri, " because Mariategui was a man ofample concepts, and an ample spirit, Mariategui was not sectarian
    He was not narrow minded, and he was very gentlemanly in hisideas. "That seems like a defense of Mariategui, but in reality it isthe worst offense that can be done to Mariategui. Mariateguiwould accept anything except that, whic.h is like tellingIm: you20

Mariateguiounded the Communist Partv of Peru, which at first was not thusnamed: it was named the Socialist Party. There arises theaforementioned Mr. Ravines saying, "we can prove it withdocuments and everything else, he says with trembling voice thathe Mariateguil founded the Socialist Party and not the
    Communist Party. "I founded the Communist Party, states the

    Party, but affiliated to the III International and subject toprinciples stipulated by Lenin in 1919. How is that about?
    Mariategui creating a Socialist Party instead of a Communist
    Party, however one affiliated to the Communist International?
    Were those really ignorant people who theought that this party wasnot the Communist Party, yet in reality it was? Mariategui wroteits constitutive charter, its birth certificate.

    Mariategui dedicated his life and tireless work to accomplish whathe thought was his duty, to participate in the strugge for
    Peruvian socialism. But he wasn't only a mere participant but theone who generated it. Since then, socialism in our country has afiliation, an ideal. We are in thele process of rediscovering the figureof Mariategui
    WE ARE THE LEGITIMATE HEIRS OF MARIATEGU
    We want to speak about the actuality of Mariategui. But first wemust speak of the enemies of Mariategui. You already know thathe died young, at age 35; his work remained largely to be doneand he set the bases for his practical work. His work has hadmany ups and downs: open felonies, unto

    following his thought? In no way is this possible. How could theyhave been followers of Mariategui when, unlike the AmautaTNF: El Amauta referring to Mariategui, the teacher] who heldthat the country is semi-feudal and semi-colonial, they hold, withvery loose bones and shamelessly, that Peru is a dependentnation? How can they be followers of Mariategui? Theesegentlemen say, and it is on their posters, in their documentsaround everywhere, they claim that Mariategui's thought is stillcurrent, is still real, concrete, that Mariategui's economic analysisis still reality in our country, but that Peruvian society issemifeudal and dependent. Let's repeat what Mariategui says?
    Mariategui says that Perd is a semi-feudal and semi-colonialcountry, and that Its semi-colonial character will go on worseningand establishing itself more with the increased penetration of
    Imperialism
    et s as
    ourselves a simple question: Has
    imperialism penetration increased or not since the time of
    Mariategui? Thele Clear answer 1s obvlously yes.It has penetratedmore
    Imperialis
    hasPenetrated more, has what Mariategui
    said been fulfilled or not? He told us that with the furtherpenetration of imperialism, and of semi-colony we would be evenmore at risk of becoming a total colony, that is, definitely losingour sovereignty. Mariategui proposed, for instance, a workers andpeasants front and to make Soviets. And what do

    Preclaimed toowers oof Mariategui preachh They preach to makea front with the bourgeoisie. How about the workers andpeasants? They are not in their plans, except for the very few theyring in pulling them from their ears, to falsely represent thegenuine workers. But what do these supposed followers say? Thatwe should participate in elections that through elections we wilconquer power. What kind of followers are these? I refer myself to
    Mariategui's documents. Can these gentlemen be called followersof Mariategui? No. They are smokers of Mariategui, arsonists of
    Mariategui's work. They burn a lot of frank incense for thepurpose of covering the saint with ashes, to tar him so no one will

Whenshould we be much happier of the fact that he was born, like forthe great fiscures of the world, nobody celebrates the day Lenindied, but all celebrate the day on which Lenin was alive. We knowthem better for their deeds. We must not accept that. We mustfight all those who oppose Mariategui, who denies he. But it is notonly Mariategui who has those kinds of enemies

    He also has hidden enemies. Those individuals who keep onsaying: "On what year was it that Mariategui wrote? In 1928? Ah!

    national situation: which of course it is absurd. That is not wherethe problem lies, it is not a matter of accumulating data, becausewe simply are not mere counting machines; the problem lies onthe interpretation, and Mariategui called it Seven Essays of
    Interpretation, not seven essays of data accumulation. And theproblem of interpretation is a problem of class position, of
    Proletarian ideolo' gyand of dialectical materialist method. Whathappens is that his superseders have yet to grasp the problem ofknowledge in the bourgeoisie and in the proletarian. Whathappens Isthat these superseders want to make a Marxistinterpretation of Peri, with a bourgeois concept in their heads,that is what really happens. What is the end result? A chili potwhich not even they themselves are able to digest and that is howambiguous things get: "Peri is semi-capitalist, Peri is a semi-
    coon
    Peru is a neo-colony,but Pert is the same time semi-
    feudal, at the same time that it is capitalist. "But what the hell is
    Peru? The problem with these individuals is that they lack unitof thought, not because they are less intelligent. They may have agreat intelligence, great wit, but they lack a base. It is a likebuilding a house that has a roof but lack of a foundation. Theylack class position and that is why they cannot go further. Theydigress, make grandiose interpretative schemes, lucid and brilliantschemes about a stage of the country or of todays Peruviansocieety, but they are unable to get to the crux of the problem and
    therefore, end up talking about Peru having curious situations ofclass or curious alliances. There is nothing curious in Peri, societyis not curious at all
    Society is governed by laws, but those who do not follow Marxismcannot understand those laws. To these friends

    One of the most debated problems is the capitalist character of
    Peru, because Mariategui held that Peri is semi-feudal and that iscorrect. Thevy
    m Mariategui made a mistake because he said we
    are semi-feudal when we are capitalist. what happens is that at thebottom of the thought of those individuals there is no dialecticmechanism, they believe that revolution is not feasible unless theorces of production are largely developed. Thaat concept was

    Some people claim to have superseded Mariategui. In what doesthis betterment consist? Where is the well-thought document
    Showin
    us that the country is this or that way, or that the
    revolution must have this or that character? That is anotherproblem, because Mariategui says that the first stage of the
    Peruvian revolution is national democratic, peoples democraticout the superseders of Mariategui say, no, the revolution issocialist. Finally, there is another set of twisters, they extract orcut little sentences of Mariategui's work, then begin to makeweird mental elaborations, somewhere Mariategui says somethingabout rel

    but then some rub their hands with glee, their soft hands whichhave never done any field work, and say: deep down Mariateguiwas a mystic and not a Marxist, he was a humanist that suffered
    an
    Pained for Peru
    Mariategui set forth clearly that Marxism-leninism is universal
    The superseders take hold for one sentence of his in which he saidthat the revolution in Peru will not be traced nor copied
    Mariategui set forth Marxism as a universal truth and thatuniversal truth he transferred into our reallty. It is not as some saythat Mariategui attempted to squeeze reality within the narrow26

    Marxist scheme that is what Mr. Victor Andres Belaunde saidNo. Mariategui has not done that. Mariategui was not a senselessman. Mariategui was a Marxist man and he understood things asa scientist, although he had an anti university feelings, this wasbecause he was against the rigid, obsolete and a feudal universitywe had in our country, not against the peoples university whichhe shone with his thought
    Reactionaries pretended to show a bourgeois or petty-bourgeois
    Mariategui, and some have even said Mariategui was a populist

    evelope
    the pro-peasantry thought in Peri, a Mariategui who
    did not develop a proletarian conception, but a conception fromthe viewpoint of the peasantry. That is a lie and a gross distortion
    Mariategui is a Marxist, he does not have the peasantry viewpointbecause if he had it, he would be a petty bourgeois revolutionaland nothing else
    TO STUDY AND TO DEFUSE
    What conclusions must we the revolutionaries draw about
    Mariateguis thought? First, to study and diffuse ose
    Caros
    Mariategui. Why study Mariategui? Because muchIS Spokenabout him in our country, but very little by him is read. Let's do aretrospective analysis and see if we have read the 10 little volumeswritten by Mariategui? Strictly speaking, do we know his politicalproposals Are we familiar with his anti-imperialism viewpoint?
    How many times have we think about the problem of an antiimperialist viewpoint? How much have we meditated about theproblems of Mariategui? Not much
    Mariategui is a man who shines in our country: there is no oneelse of this magnitude. What figure do they pretend tocounterpoise? To Mr. Riva Aguero, that aprentice of fascism who

    never even became a consistent one? Neither did Don Victor
    Andres Belaunde managed to put forth a consistent thought
    Belaunde is a superficial man, who today is taken for a thinker
    His work on St. Agustine does not go beyond pure quackery, it ishell without substance. We must spread Mariategui's thought
    What have we done for the fortieth anniversary of Mariategui?
    Have we studied him in depth? Have we held discussions at thebase level, organize seminars and conferences on the Seven
    Essays? Have we attempted to try to apply what Mariategui saidand to follow his line to understand in that light, the currentsituation in the country? Have we Dicked up the lantern to be ableto see where we are going? We have not done so. Concretely, here
    IS
    what I propose. I think we must set forth activities to
    P
    commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the Seven Essays. Howdo we do that? For now, at least by discussing it. Secondly, itseems to me that we have another task: the problem of defendingg
    Mariategui, who is being attacked openly, and covert
    Mariategui is a source of light which we cannot allow to be turnedoff, to be slander, we cannot allow for it to be seemed throughcolored lenses. so we would be forced to see black what is red. sohis fundamental ideas would get twisted. We cannot allow thatre have to defend Mariategui, becauseifwe do not

    Mariategui will be continued to be cast aside. Wed then betollowing the same policy of the reactionaries: what reaction did,was to take Mariategui, chained and threw him in jail, and thentried to silence his ideas
    We must free Mariategui, because if we do not, then neither carwe liberate ourselves. Of course, this is not a personal problemout a problem of liberationg al people. In third place,I think wemust further the study of Mariategui, I do not pretend tosupersede or overcome Mariategui, I do no want to be classified inquarters o

    the Peruvian economy of 1968, in the light of the 1928 essay: Itwould be magnificent thing to do the same with literature, withthe problem of the land, women and other problems. I think thatthis is a duty and we the intellectuals, must fulfill it, and theworkers as well as the peasants because we find many portions ofhis work which refer to them in plain and clear language. Inconclusion, Mariategui is a great example, united with otherfigures in our history, such as, for example, Tupac Amaru
    THIE EXAMPLE OE MARIATEGU
    Mariategui is a historic figure of our country. Even if a recent onehe already has a perfect historical dimension that excels. He is thecountry's ideologist. There is no other one. The reactionaryideologists are dwarfed and defeated by Mariategui
    We must do it. How wonderful it would be if there were a fewmore people like him! Because I am quite convinced thatdividuals like Mariategui are not born and forge everry a
    but
    rery once in a while. His family name can be canned andassumed by his relatives or not. What matters here is the example
    We must raise hisS ngure as an example to follow, as gulde osf therevolution in our country, and our countryS dee

    will change even more. It has been said, nobody can stop history,it may be deviated a bit for a short while, but not more
    Mariategui, therefore, is an example to us, but an example ofwhat? Mariategui is an example of proletarian revolutionary, notmore, not less. We do not make him bigger. Mariategui doesntwant that we exalt him nor he wants that we take away his merits
    If we say he is an example of a revolutionary, then we would bstrippin
    him of hhis proletarian famlly name, If we take
    proletarian position out of him, then Mariategui would be just one

    Mariategui's work a theoretical development, a Marxist-leninistanalysis of our problems, a great theoretician of Perd and of LatinAmerica
    We must follow that example; I am not proposing that we mustbe equal to him, but only that we follow his road. For instance Icould make a little prologue. For instance, I could do somethingtollowing his light on this level, and by doing so I would be anitty bitty theoretician, but I am on his road, and if we jointogether all the itty bitty truths that we may be reaching at whiletollowing the road of Mariategui, then it becomes a huge river oftruth. Who is more responsible for doing this? The intellectuals
    But not the plain intellectuals because our country and itsdevelopment not only demand intellectuals: It demandsrevolutionary intellectuals. What does it mean? Mao Tse-tunganswer is luminous and precise and very realistic when he says wemust fuse ourselves with the exploited masses of workers andpeasants. He says that very concretely. If one wants to berevolutionary intellectual then one must fuse himself with themasses, work with them, feel like they do and think like they do
    But this is a process, because we must leave aside our status, ourbusiness suits, we must become revolutionary intellectuals. That isa reflection proper to all of us, which carries us to the second part
    In Mariategui, we see the man of action, a doer, even when heconfronted some personal problems, like his family, his health, healways put those problems behind his main task

    I. THE WOMAN QUESTION AND MARXISM
    The woman question is an important question for the popularstruggle and its importance is greater today because actions areintensifying which tend to mobilize women; a necessary anefruitful mobilization from the working class viewpoint and in theservice of the masses of the people, but which promoted by andor the benefit of the exploiting classes, acts as an element which
    Ivides anId fetters the people's struggle
    In this new period of politicization of thee masses of women Inwhich we now evolve. with its base in a
    reater economic
    participation by women in the country, it is indispensable to payserious attention to the woman question as regards study andresearch, political incorporation and consistent organizing work
    A task which demands keeping in mind Mariateguis thesis whichteaches that: " WOMEN LIKE MEN ARE REACTIONARIES

    That way, from the beginning, the need to understand the womanquestion scientifically doubtlessly demands that we start from the
    Marxist concept of the working class

    Lord who has created me according to his will, "clearly expressthe contempt the ancient world had for the womans condition
    These ideas also predominated in Greek slave society; the famous
    Pythagoras said "There is a good principle which has createdorder, light and man and there is a bad principle which hascreated chaos, darkness and woman; and even the greathilosopher Aristotle pronounced: the female is female by virtueot certain9ualitative fault, "and " the character of women suffersfrom a natural defect
    These proposals passed on to the final period of Roman slavesociety and to the Middle Ages, the contempt for womanintensifying in Christian thinkers by imputing her with being thesource of sin and the waiting room of hell. Tertulian claimed
    Woman you are the door of the devil. You havePersuaded hiwhom the devil did not dare to attack frontally. By your fault theson of God had to die: you should always go dressed in mourningand rags; and Augustine of Hipona"The woman is a beast whois neither firm nor stable. "While these condemned, others passedsentence on feminine inferiority and obedience; thus Paul of
    Tarsus, the apostle, preached "Man was not taken from womanbut woman from man; and Just as the church is subject to
    Christ, let woman be submitted in all things to her husband
    And huundreds o
    rears later, in the 13th century, Thomasye
    Aquinas followed with similar preaching: Man is the head of the9
    woman, just as Christ is the head of man and"It is a fact thatwoman is destined to live under the authority of man and that she

    Christian positions, and reiterating old theses sanctioned through

    That way we see how throughout time the exploiting classes havereached the"deficient feminine nature.

    Women got mobilized together with the masses, and participatingin the civic clubs, they developed revolutionary actions. In thesestruggles they organize

    Even more, with bourgeois reorganization initiated by Napoleon,with the Civil Code, a married woman returned to be subiect topatronage,falling under her husbands domain in her person andgoods; she is denied the questioning of paternity.

    The French Revolution raised its three principles of liberty,equality and fraternity and promised justice and to meet thedemands of the people.

    gainst such an order of things the utopians launched
    themselves with a sharp and demolishing criticism although, dueto historic conditions, they could not reach the root of the evil
    Utopian socialists also condemned the condition of women undercapitalism. Fourier, representing this position, pointed out: Thechange of an historical age can always be determined by theprogress of women
    e degree of emancipation of woman
    constitutes the natural Dath for general emancipation
    Confronted with this great assertion it's worth counterpoising thethought of the anarchist Proudhon about women, and keep inmind his ideas when there are attempts today to propagateanarchism to the four winds, presenting them as examples orevolutionary vision and consequence. Proudhon maintained thatwoman was Inferior to man physically, intellectually and morally,

But theeminist movement In general oriented Itse.a ftowards suffragism, to the struggle to get the right to vote forwomen, in pursuit of the false idea that in getting the vote andparliamentary positions their rights would be respected; that wayfeminist actions were channeled towards parliamentary cretinism
    However it is good to remember that the vote was not achievedtor free but that during the last century and the start of this
    centurywomen fought openly and determinedly to get it. The
    struggle for the feminine vote and its achievement show oncemore that, while this indeed was a conquest, it is not the meansallowing a genuine transformation of the condition of women

    In conclusion, through the economic incorporation of women,capitalism set the basis for their economic autonomy; butcapitalism by itself is not capable of giving formal legal equality towomen; in no way can it emancipate them; this has been proventhroughout the histoyof the bourgeoisie, a class which even inits most advanced revolution. the French Revolution of the 18thcentury, could not go further than a merely formal declaration ofrights.

    ThisParaguaaph by Engels sets the fundamental thesis of Marxismabout the woman question: the condition of women is sustainedin property relations, in thee form of ownership exercised over themeans of production and In the productive relations arising fromthem. This thesis of Marxism is extremely important because itestablishes that the oppression attached to the female conditionhas as its roots the formation, appearance and development of thetht to ownership over the means of production, and thereforethat its emancipation is linked to the destruction of said rightis indispensable, in order to have a Marxist understanding of thewoman question, to start from this great thesis, and more thanever today when supposed revolutionaries and even self-proclaimed Marxists pretend to have feminine oppression arisingnot from the formation and appearance of private property butfrom the simple division of labor as a function of sex which hadattributed less important chores to women than those of menreducing her to the sphere of the home. This proposal, despite allne propaganda and efforts to present it as revolutionary, is butthe substitution for the Marxist position on the emancipation of
    women, with bourgeois proposals which in essence are but
    variations of the supposed immutable "feminine nature

    point said Gaius, the Roman jurist: Tutelage was established inthe interest of the tutors themselves. so the woman of whom theare supposed heirs cannot wrest their willed inheritance fromthem, nor impoverish it by alienation or debts.

    By the end of the Republic mothers had been given recognizedrights over their children, receiving custody of them due to thefathers misconduct or his being placed under tutelage
    Under emperor Marcus Aurelius, in the vear 178, a great step istaken in the process of propertv and family: children are declaredheir to their mother in preference to agnates; that way the familyis based on a link of consanguinity and the mother emerges asequal to the father before the children, the children also arerecognized as children of the wife and, derived from thee above,the daughter inherits just as her male siblings
    But while the State emancipates women from the familsubmits them to its tutelage and restricts their acts. Andsimultaneously to the social rise of women, an anti-feministcampaign was initiated in Rome invoking their inferiority andinvoking their "imbecility and fragility of the sexto legally

    working class positions and apply them to understand the womanquestion, participate in its solution, and reject, constantly anddecisively, the distortions of Marxist theses on the subject and theso-called superior developments which are but attempts tosubstitute bourgeois ideas for proletarian concepts on this frontto disorient the women's movement on the march
    Having exposed the social condition of women and the historicaloutline of its development linked to property, family and Statewhat remains is to treat the question of the emancipation ofwomen from a Marxist viewpoint
    Marxism fundamentally holds that the development of machineryincorporates women, as well as children, into the productive

    destroying the

    women and materially and morally sinking them into the miseriesof exploitation
    Analyzing women and children at work Karl Marx wrote: " In soar as machinery dispenses with muscular power, it becomes ameans of employing laborers of slight muscular strength, anethose whose bodily development is incomplete, but whose limbsare
    le more supple.The labor of women and children was
    therefore, the first cry of the capitalist application of machinery

    The value of labour-power was determined, not only by labourtime necessary to maintain the individual adult laborer, but alsoby that necessary to maintain his family. Machinery, by throwinevery member of that family on to the labour-market, spreads thevalues of the man's labour-power over his whole family. It thusdepreciates his labour-power. Thus we see, that machinery,
    menting the human material that forms the principal
    obiect of capitals exploiting power, at the same time raises thelegree of exploitation
    By opening the factory doors to women and children, makingthem flock in great numbers to the combined ranks of theworking class, machinery finally breaks down thele resistance of themale worker to this, despite the despotism of capital withinmanufacturing. (Capital, Volume I, pp. 394-395. Economic
    Culture Fund, 1966. Emphasis in original.
    Continuing his masterful analysis, Marx himself describes to usow capitalism uses even the virtues and obligations of womenfor its advantage: " Mr. E, manufacturer, told me how in histextile mills he employed exclusively women, preferably marriedones, and above all those who had at home a family living from ordepending on her salary, since these were much more active and

    than single women,

    sustenance to their families forced them to work harder. In thisway, the virtues characterizing women are turned against themall the purity and sweetness of their character are turned intoinstruments of torture and slavery. (Note 57 of above quotedvolume and edition of Capital, P.331)

However, with all thepositive aspects that the incorporation of women into the French
    Revolution had, the resulting politicization of women was butelementary, restricted and very small compared to the maioradvance represented
    te politicization of women by the
    working classes. What does this politicization imply? Whencapitalism massively

    organization
    by incorporating herself, through her best
    representatives, into the ranks of the Party of the working class, toserve the people in all forms and fronts of struggle organized andled by the working class through its political vanguard. Thispoliticization process which only the proletariat is capable ofproducing and the new type of women fighters it generates hasmaterialized in the many glorious womenfigters whose namesare recorded in history: Luisa Michel, N. Krupskaya, Rosa
    Luxemburg, Liu Ju-lan and others whose memory thee people anthe proletariat keep
    For Marxism yesterday like today the politicization of women isne key issue in her emancipation, and the classics dedicatedthe
    special attention to it. Marx taught: " Anyone who knowssomething of history knows that the great social changes areimpossible without the feminist ferment. Social progress can bemeasured exactly by the social position of the weak sex. "(Letterto Kugelmann, 1888 )And to Lenin the participation of womenwas more much urgent and important to the revolution
    The experience of all the liberation movements confirms that thesuccess of the revolution depends on the degree in which womenparticipate. (Our emphasis.
    Thus the development of the class struggle and its ever greatersharpening, within the specific social conditions of therevolutionary struggle under conditions of imperialism, sets forthand demands more decisively the politicization of women; that iswhy Lenin himself, in the middle of World War I and foreseeingfuture battles for the working class which required preparednesscalled to fight for: 17.

    This brings us to consider HOW CAN THE EMANCIPATIONOF WOMEN BE ACHIEVED? Investigating capitalist society anesocieties in gteneral where exploitation and oppression prevail
    Engels verified that misery, inequality and submission existamong men, and emphasizing the woman question he pointeout, " The state of affairs with respect to the equality of men andwomen is no better than their legal inequality, which we haveinherited from prior social conditions, is not the cause but theeffect of the economic oppression of women. " And he continued
    Women cannot be emancipated unless theyassume a largesocially measurable role in production and are only tiedinsignificantly by domestic work. And this has only been possiblewith modern industry, which not only admits feminine labor in aarge scale but fatally demands it
    This assertion by Engels, taken out of context and unrelated tosimilar ones from Origin.. helps some people, pseudo-marxistsand distorters of Marxism, stretching his ideas, to claim that themere participation of women in the economic process is sufficientfor their emancipation. Engels proposed that the incorporation ofwomen into production was a condition, that it is a base uponwhich women act in favor of their emancipation, and that thisdemands to socially end domestic work which absorbs aneannihilates women, which to Engels implies destroying privateownership of the means of production and developingarge-scaleproduction based on the Soclal ownershipof the productivemeans. We repeat that it is good to be very clear about this thesisby Engels, because today some attempt to hide theemselves inclassic to distort the Marxist position on the woman question and
    preach, for the sake of the exploiting classes, on the plain andsimple participation of women in the economic process, hidingthe root of womens oppression which is private ownership andsidestepping large-scale social production based on destroyingprivate property of the means of production

    Foreseeing this distortion, as in other cases, the classics analyzedthe problem of whether the incorporation of women to thproductive process, which capitalism began, was capable ofmaking men and women truly equal. The concise and poweanswer was given once more by Mao Tse-tung in the 1950s
    TRUE EQUALITY BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN CANONLY BE ACHIEVED N THIE PROCESS OF THE SOCALSTTTRANSFORMATION OF THE WHOLE OF SOCIETY
    Lenin researched the situation of women in bourgeois society andcompared it with how it was under the dictatorship of theproletariat; an analysis which led him to establish: "From remotetimes,he representatives of all the movements of liberation inwestern Europe, not for decades, but during centuries, proposethe abolition of these antiquated laws and demanded the legalequality of women and men, but no democratic European State,not even the most advanced republics, have managed to achievethis, because wherever capitalism exists, whereverPrivateownership of the factories is maintained, wherever the power ofcapital is maintained, men go on eniovingg privileges.
    From the first months of its existence, Soviet power, as thepower of workers, realized the most decisive and radical legislativechange with respect to women. In the Soviet Republic no stonewas left unturned which kept women in a position of dependenceI am referring precisely to those laws which used the dependentsituation of women in a special way, making her victim of theinequality of rights and often even of humiliations, that is to saylaws on divorce, on natural children and on the right of women tosue the father in court to support the child.

    the revolution which places the workingclass in power in alliancewith the peasantry is capable of sanctioning thele true iudicial legalequality between men and women, and even further, of enforcingit. However, as Lenin himself taught, this true legal equalityinitiated by the revolution is but the beginning of a protractedstruggle for the full and complete equality in life of men anewomen: "However, the more we rid ourselves of the burden of oldbourgeois laws and institutions, the more clearly we see that wehave barely cleared the terrain for construction, yet constructionitself has not begun

    The above, in essence, shows there is an identity of strugglebetween the revolutionary feminist movement and the workingclass struggle for the construction of a new society; and, besides, ithelps to understand the sense of Lenins words calling womenworkers to develop the institutions and means which therevolution placed at their disposal: "We say that the emancipationof workers must be the work of the workers themselves anelikewise THE EMANCIPATION OF WOMEN WORKERS

On thisparticular, it suffices to saythat the analysis of the condition ofwoman through history shows her as subject to tutelage and in asituation of submission with respect to the male, which makeswoman a being who, WIThile belonging to the same class as herhusband or the man she has a relationship with, finds herself in asituation of inferiority with respect to him, an inferiority whichthe laws bless, sanctify and impose.

    researchingthe nascent Peruvian feminist movement he said
    Men who are sensible to the great emotions of our times cannotand should not feel themselves out of place or indifferent to thiISmovement. The woman question is part of the human question
    So lets keep in mind that from the beginning of its politicalemergence the working class of thilis country paid attention to thesituation of women, establishing through its great representativetheir position with respect to women, as well as offering fightingsupport to feminist struggles, as shown by the solidarity of textileworkers and drivers with the women workers of A. Field Co, in1926.
    What was the feminist development which attracted such accurateattention? The condition of women in the country suffered anoticeable change especially in this century and more specificallyafter the two world wars. While the condition of peasant womenchanged more slowly, that of her sisters turned workers andprofessionals experienced more rapid and profoun
    Changes
    Evidently the presence of women in our society has beenconquering positions ever more widely.
    Last century the action and literary work of Clorinda Matto de
    Turner, Mercedes Cabello de Carbonera and Margarita Praxedes
    Munoz, highlighted the feminine presence over a background ofmillions of peasants, workers and other women who, whileanonymous, were subiect to harsh social repression of feudalroots. The Peruvian woman of the 19th Century haad minimaaccess to education. and when she was allowed to attendsecondary education, the educational norms followed wouldestablish for her a watered down curriculum comparable to thelast primary grade for males plus some of the secondary schoolcourses these would follow. The abandonment of feminineschooling is clearly shown by the fact that, while there were

    incorporation into production and under bureaucratic capitalismpushed forward by North American imperialism and by theirincreased access to education, especially at the university. Theseare the bases on which the first feminist impetuses of the countrywill hatch, a phenomenon which Mariategui described as follows
    Feminism has not made its appearance in Peru artificially orarbitrarily. It has appeared as result of the new forms ofintellectual and manual labor of women. The women with truefeminist affiliations are those women who work. the women whostudy. The feminist idea prospers among women in intellectualjobs and in manual jobs: professors, university students, workers
    It finds a propitious environment for its development in theuniversity classrooms, which attract more Peruvian women everyday; and in the workers unions, where factory women enroll andorganize with the same rights and the same duties as the men
    Besides this, we have the feminism of dilettantes, a little pedantic
    annd a little mundane. For feminists of this kind, feminism is a
    mere literary exercise, merely a fashionable sport. ( Feminist
    Demands; our emphasis.
    It is on this basis that Mariategui elaborated the position of the
    Peruvian proletariat on the woman question, by establishing the

    On this basis Mariategui goes on to the material analysis of
    Peruvian women belonging to the difterent classes; he masterfullydepicts working women: "if the masses of vouth are so cruelexploited, proletarian women suffer equal or worse exploitation
    Up to very recently the proletarian woman had her labor limitedto domestic activities at home. With advancing industrializationshe enters the competition in the factory, shop, enterprise, etc
    Thus we see her in textile factories, cracker factories. laundriescontainer and cardboard box factories, soaps, etc., where sheperforms the same work as the male worker, from operating themachinery, to the most menial job, always earning 40% to 60%ess than the male.

    As we saw, for Mariategui industrialization incorporates womaninto work and through this it transforms her condition and herspirit. He points out, like the classics, the double situationimplied: When woman advances on the road of heremancipation over a bourgeois democratic terrain, in exchange
    this fact provides the capitalist with cheap labor and at the sametime a serious competitor to the male worker. "(Above cited

    'The French Revolution, however, inaugurated a regime ofpolitical equality for men, not for women. The Rights of Man
    cou
    ave Deen called rather, theRights of Males. With the
    bourgeoisie women ended up much more alienated from politicsthan with the aristocracy. Bourgeois democracy was an exclusivelymale democracy. Its development had to end up

    intensely favorable to the emancipation of women. Capitalistcivilization provided women with the means of increasing the

    capacitv and improving their position in life
    Therefore, what the bourgeois class does for women was setaccurately: while it is capable of providing conditions for herdevelopment, it is incapable of emancipating her. Mariateguinew this very well: how despite this limitation capitalism, as itdevelops, opens up for women the doors to various activitiesincluding politics, very especially so in the 20th century,So muchthat it becomes a symbol of this. Developing this statement,
    Mariategui himself vindicates many notable women and pointsout and demonstrates the contributions many women have madeto poetry, to the novel, to the arts in general to the struggle anpolitics. Thus hele teaches us how to iudse women o

    roposal on the

    parts
    are
    noteworthy: Teminism, politicization of women and organization

    neither artificially nor arbitrarily among us but it correspondswith the incorporation of women into manual and intellectualwork; in this viewpoint he highlights mainly that feminism thrivesamong women who work outside the home, and points out thatthe proper environments for the development of the feministmovement are the university classrooms and the labor unions. Hethen sets forth the directive of orienting ourselves towards thosefronts so as to push forward the mobilization of women. Althoughit must be decided that such orientation in no way impliesdiscounting peasant women; since we must remember that
    Mariategui considered the peasant women as the most importantclass in our process, no doubt peasant women too are a front ofmobilization and even more. the main source which the entirefeminist movement as well as the proletariat want to reach.
    In Feminist Demands Mariategui proposes thee essence o
    e
    feminist movement: "No one should be surprised if all women donot get together in a single feminist movement. Feminism hasnecessarily, several colors, various tendencies. In feminism threefundamental tendencies can be distinguished, three substantivecoors
    ourgeois
    feminism, petty-bourgeois feeminism an
    roletarian feminism. Each one of these feminisms formulates its
    Pown demands in a different way. The bourgeois woman unites
    feminism with the interests of the conservative class. Theroletarian woman unifies her feminism with the faith of the
    Prevolutionary multitudes in the society of the future. The class
    struggle-an historical fact and not merely a theoretical asserticis reflected on the feminist stage. Women, like men, arereactionaries, centrists or revolutionaries. They cannotconsequently, all fight the same battle side by side. In the currenthuman panorama, class differentiates individuals more than sex
    This is the essence of our woman question, the class character ofthe entire feminist movement. And we must keep this very much82

    in mind, today more than ever, since once more the organizationof women is pushed forward; many groups arise, which in generalare silent or hide the class character sustaining them, that is, theclass which they serve, and preach a unification of women todemand their rights in opposition to men, as if to serve allwomenunited, without distinction of class, for a supposed socitransformation humanist, Christian and in solidarity socialtransformation, going through a few intermediate modalities ofunclear or confused class positions Substantially the problem is toascertain the class root entailed by each womens grouporganism, front or movement, to delimit positions and establishwhom they serve, which class they serve, and if they are truly orare not on the side of the people
    These questions take us to a crucial problem: according to whoseprinciples, which class criteria and orientation are we to build afeminist movement serving the people? Here Mariategui's positionis brilliant and concise"Feminism, as a pure idea, is essentiallyrevolutional「y
    And to him, revolutionary essenti

    With respect to the POLITICIZATION OF WOMEN. The
    Marxist classics have always attached great importance to this
    Doint, since without it, it is impossible to develop the mobilizationand organization of women, and without these women we cannotfight side by side with the proletariat for their own emancipation

    Here Mariategui's thesis is materialized by the need to pay
    attention to the women s organizations, even at the most
    advanceed political levels; and his position is expressed that the
    organization of women is, ultimately, the question of organizingthem under the leadership and control of the working class andthe Party.

    Besides these basic ideas Mariategui takes care of other problemsintimately linked to women in particular: divorce, marriage, loveetc. he treats them with fine irony and takes sharply criticalpositions on them.

Tolo so is to forget the principal struggle and fundamental goalwhile Spreading confusion and disorientingthe revolutionarystruggle

    consistent application of Marxism-leninism to the specificconditions in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society like ours
    On this, generally, theere Is no disagreement and even when thereis no open adherence, at least by silence an acceptance of suchconclusions is shown. However the question is not whether
    Mariategui's thought was a correct application of Marxism to thecountr
    the central issue is: how relevant is his thought to the
    present? This is a subject on which, while expressing an apparentrecognition of Mariategui and so as not to attack his immense andstill growing prestige, some question its current relevance bymentioning that more than 40years have elapsed and raising,erroneously and treacherously, the need to take into accountthecreative development of Marxism in order to surpass it.
    Analyzing this point leads us to review, if only in passing, some ofthe positions that have been sustained in this country on thewoman question. Thus, the notable and contentious thinker don
    Manuel Gonzales Prada handled this question in his 1904 work
    Slaves of the Church. "a work now included in Hours of
    Struggle. There, while expressing important concepts such as
    We cant know the people well until we have studied the social
    annd legal condition of women, the moral elevation of man is
    measured by the concept he has on women: for the ignorant andbrutal man, the woman is iust a female: for the thinker andcultured man, she is a brain and a heart, Just as we carry theamily name of our father, we carry the moral makingg of ourmother .The motive force, the great propellant of societiesdoes not function noisily at the plaza nor at the revolutionarycircle; it works in the home, which help to center our attention
    onthe importance of the woman; on the other hand, he expresses
    ideas such as " Thele emancipation of woman,like the freedom ofthe slave, is not due to Christianity but to Philosophy. " "In
    Protestant nations feminine ascension is taking place so assuredlythat complete emancipation is already foreseen, " Slaves and serfs88

    the oppression of women, the important role they fulfill

    What does this summary show us? The hard, cold truth that thequestion is by no means the time frame when the positions arepresented, nor is the problem"to take into account the creativedevelopments of Marxism, but what is central is the classposition on which a proposal is based. We have seen a positionrior to Mariategui, that of Gonzalez Prada, which despitepreceding Mariategui by some 30 years entails many positiveelements; as well as a position contemporaneous with Mariateguithat of Basadre, which is openly reactionary: finally two laterpositions, 30 years after Mariategui, that of Miro Quesada, whichrenovates some criteria but is still reactionary, and that of themagazine Mujer, under Marxist colors, which definitely adheres toourgeois positions despite it being presented to us asrevolutionary and in the service of women's emancipation
    What is the conclusion? As we said, the question is the classcharacter on which a position is based, in this case the position onthe woman question. With Mariategui, the greatest exponent ofour working class, the proletarian position on
    e woman
    question is established. He set the basis of the proletarian politicalline on this question and his positions are completely current, onthis topic as well as on others dealing with the revolutionarypolitics ofthe proletariat in our country. Therefore, develoding apeople's feminist movement demands, today morethan ever, afirm and consistent adherence to the thought of Mariateguistarting from an acceptance of its current relevance

On the other hand, atle beginning oof the XIX century Peru was a feudal country andour society was fundamentally based on agriculture, which wasthe economic base.

    Our country was backward, where the norm was the practice ofold forms of production and modalities of government that weretotally decrepit.

England introduces higher modalitiesof development in the country, capitalist modalitiesfundamentally in trade which was tied to the world market of thetertilizer guano(TNF: seabird excrement ). As a result, thedestruction of feudalism advanced because England broughtmerchandise and introduced capitalist method of production. Onthe other hand, England began to control the countrry andintroduced a process of colonialization.

The U.S. came when it was alreadyan imperialist country, with a developed system of monopoliesand big corporations that concentrate the U.S.'S economy. It wasalready a power undergoing a colonial expansion inLatinAmerica and even in parts of Asia.
    Under the Yankee imperialist domination, our society evolvesurther its semifeudal character. However. it is not totalldestroved. It continues to survive. In the same manner that underEnglish domination (especially after the war with Chile), therehas been a maior push toward the destruction of feudalism underthe development of a form of capitalism tied to the bi8monopolies and dependent upon imperialism. In addition tomaintaining its semifeudal character, our country continues to bea semicolony; a dominated country that even though has declaredits political independence is under the domination of animperialist power in economic, diplomatic, cutural, and militaryaffairs. This domination turns Peru's declared pol

    T'HE NATIONAL QUESTION
    In syntheis, since the XIX century, Peruvian society has evolvefrom a feudal society into a semifeudal one, and from a colonialsociety into a semicolonial one. In this long process, three powershave dominated and exploited us: First Spain until 1821 (althoughit continued its domination for many more decades. )Then
    England dominated us in a more subtle way. The British evenabricated for us political parties of a bourgeois nature, aneorganized a better state apparatus in order to subjugate us betterwith its subtle domination. It was a subtile domination but noless exploitative than the previous one. Finally, the U. S, whichcontinues to oppress and exploit us, an imperialism that despiteall that is said (about "independence, )dominates us on all levels
    When we were a colonial country we had two problems: the laneproblem and the national question. Under English domination we
    were a semifeudal and semicoma societety (less developed than
    the present time), and had two problems: the land and the nation
    The land was concentrated in a few hands and servitudecontinued to exist in the country. In the XX century under U.Sdomination, we continue to be a semifeudal and semicolonialsociety (undoubtedly much more evolved than before)but thebasic problems of the country continue to be the two mentionedbefore: the land and the nation. The land question is because thefeudal modalities of exploitation still survive and grip our entiresociety. Thus, our unscientific and superstitious mentality, ourideology in general, as well as our social and political relationsstill have many feudal asbects. The national question is because

    The character of the revolutionary process of Peruvian society
    ain8down the character of Peruvian society a question arises
    which is the path of revolutionary transformation? Concretely,what is the character of the Peruvian revolution? We haveestablished that today there are two problems: the land9uestionand the national question, from whose resolution the solution ofthe rest of the nation s problems will derive. The entire nationalquestion is tied to the semifeudal and semicolonial character of
    Peruvian society. Hence, in order for Peruvian society to change,to be truly revolutionary, these two problems must be resolved
    The land question, whose solution demands that semifeudalismbe swept awaly, unless this is donethe land question cannot be

    The national question, whose solution demands sweeping away

    Consequently, the two tasks that must be carry out in the processof transformation of Peruvian society, scientifically called the
    Peruvian revolution, is to completely destroy semifeudalism andsemicolonialism. These are the two tasks of the Peruvianrevolution in its first stage. This means that the Peruvian100

    revolution is antifeudal and antiimperialist. It must destroy theeudal remnants and the imperialist domination. For this reasonthe Peruvian revolution is necessarily democratic and national
    Scientifically speaking the character of the Peruvian revolution isa national-democratic revolution; democratic because itdestroy the feudal relations of the nation; and national because itwill destroy the Yankee imperialist oppression. Thus, in thecontemporary semi-feudal and semi-colonial Peruvian societythere is only room for a national-democratic, anti-feudal and antiimperialist revolution
    Let us analyze the character of the Peruvian revolution in relationthe concrete historical conditions. The two problems of thecountry(the land and the nation), during the XX centur
    as
    compared to the XIX century, have big differences. In the lastcentury there was no imperialism like there is today, and therewas no international working class capable of leading therevolution, nor was there a developed workingg Class In ourcountry, whereas today, we have a triumphant working classTNF: the October revolution, China, etc )and in our country wehave a working class with a long history of

    Until the 1920s, the bourgeoisie in our country was in thecapacity of leading the process of transformation towards thesolution of these two problems, but they didn't. Nevertheless, inour country, betore the 1920s, there were great struggles, heroicstruggles and continuous uprisings of peasants, mobilizations, andstudent struggles, and powerful actions of the working class. Allof this generated a great process of political struggle in which the
    gy
    of the proletariat began to be spread out and be applied
    to our reality. The extraordinary figure of Jos, Carlos Mari teguemerges, whose tireless work as a thinker and activist man

    marked a milestone in history. In 1928, Mariategui founded the
    Communit Party, the Party of the working class in Peru. Thisperiod determined a fundamental change in our revolutionthrough which the bourgeoisie, under the conditions ofimperialist domination and thele existence of a working Class forgein struggle, could no longer lead the revolutionary process of ournation

    The new bourgeois revolution or national-democratic

    After 1928 the proletariat achieved political organization anddisplaced the bourgeoisie from the historical leadership of therevolutionary process, as the only class that can complete thenational democratic revolution. Thus, after 1928 the revolution inthe country, the destruction of feudalism and imperialistdomination, can only be completed under the leadership of the

    To conclude, we must point out that there are other thesesopposite to what we have explained. For example, there is a thesisthat states that Peruvian society is capitalist. This is the mostdangerous. If the countrv is capitalist, the revolution must besocialist, and the proletariat and not the peasantry would be theprincipaoal force. This thesis fundamentally changes the extremeimportant problem, which is the road of the revolution. As welave seen here, there are two revolutionary paths
    The path of the October revolution which is from the city tothe countryside, and this is the path of the capitalist countries byway of a socialist revolution, the path that old Russia took or thatFrance would have to take today, for example; and
    The Path of the Chinese revolution, which is trom thecountrvside to the city, and this is the path that semi-feudal ansemi-colonial countries follow by way of a national-democraticrevolution,the path the Vietnam, amon

    others. Is flown
    today. As such, the question of whether the country is semi-feudalor capitalist is not simply a Byzantine discussion, because if we errabout the character of society we err on the course of therevolution, and consequently it will not triumph
    The thesis of the capitalist character of Peruvian society has beenand continues to be upheld by Trotskyism and positions close toit, nevertheless such typifications begins to bee utheld byrevisionism in order to deepen its surrender to the regime

    society, and ignorance of it is the root of grave political errors
    The thesis of bureaucratic capitalism is found in the classics andin Mariategui, although he used another term
    What do we mean by bureaucratic capitalism?
    This is the capitalism that imperialism promotes in a backwardscountry; the type of capitalism, the special form of capitalism, that
    S Imposed by an imperialist country onto a backwards counti
    whether it is semi-feudal or semi-colonial. Let us analyze thhistoric process
    How did capitalism develop in the old Eurodean nations?
    Consider France; toward the end of the XVIII century it was afeudal country, with 20 to 22 million peasants whie workersnumbered only around 600,000(from which we can see the feudal
    Passage it had), it was based on servitude of various forms
    Nevertheless, within the feudal entrails of France new productiveorms, of manufacturing, and capitalist forms were generated, ana class, the bourgeoisie, was gaining ever more force, moreeconomic power, including political influence. We ask: WasFrance a nation subjugated by)y another? Noo. France was an
    hegemony, it was not oppressed by anyone. 4,%nd for global
    absolute monarchy that contested with En
    socio-economic
    and historical conditions had made it develop that way. Dimperialism exist in that era? No. Imperialism is of this century
    What existed were countries undergoing capitalist developmentlike England for example, and France was independentlydeveloping a capitalist society. Other countries followed the sameath, and when they reached the XIX century, France, England

    When the emancipation of America began (1810), the nations ofEurope were already powerful, whereas the Latin American oneshad only recently begun to structure their nationalities, a problemthat has not yet been concluded. Moreover, soon after becomingindependent these nations fall under the domination of a powernamely England; thus their capitalism will develop under Englishdomination, a kind of dependent capitalism. Thus, there is a well-known historical, economic, and political difference compared tothee上 uropean process
    On another side, the bourgeoisies that develop in Latin Americabegin to link themselves more and more to the dominant countin such a way that these weak bourgeoisies, instead oof developingindependently like the Eupopeans did, serving the nationalinterests, they evolve as subjugated bourgeoisies, dependent, givenover body and soul to the imperialist powers (England or the
    U. S )to the extent they even believe in converting themselves intorich men and developed intermediate bourgeoisies, as our history
    In this century shows
    This latter path is the one taken in Peru. As we have seen, in thesecond decade of this century Yankee imperialism surplantedEnglish domination

    them by means of the purchase and)ayment of the land for the
    payr
    peasants. The bureaucratic line in industry aims at controlling andcentralizing Industrial production, commerce, etc puttingtheemever more in the hands of monopoly with the goal of sponsoring amore rapid and systematic accumulation of capital, to thedetriment of the working class and other workers, naturally, tothe benefit of the biggest monopolies and consequentimperialism. In this process the forced saving which workers aresubjected to plays an important role, as we can see in theindustrial law. The bureaucratic line in ideolo8consists of theprocess of molding the people, by means of the massive diffusion,
    especia
    political conceptions and ideas, that serve
    bureaucratic capitalism. The general law of education is aconcentrated expression of this line, and one of the constants ofthis line is its anti-communism, its anti-marxism, whether open
    or concealed
    These three lines form part of the bureaucratic path which isopposed by the DEMOCRATIC PATH, the revolutionary road ofthe people. If the former defends feudal property, the latterproposes its destruction, and it opposes the buying of lands withconfiscation; if the former recognizes and fortifies imperialistindustrial property, the latter denies it and struggles forconfiscation; if the former fights to ideologically subj
    people, the latter strives to arm them ideologically; if the formerattacks Marxism, the latter upholds that we must guide ourselvesby Marxism as the only scientific instrument to understandeality. They are thus two absolutely contr

    analyze the decade of the 1960s, during which the process of thedestruction of feudalism advanced more; in this period industryand capitalist relations in agriculture are strengthened. Fromanother Side, the Class struggle developed greatly,
    tly: the trade union
    movement, the peasant movement, and the student movementreached higher levels. Thus a strong trade union movementdeveloped that in a particular moment took localities and bossesas hostages: the peasant movement also had a great apogee, in thesecond half of 1963 it ran from the center of the country to thesouth like a trail of gunpowder; and the student movement roserapidly. In synthesis, the mass struggles have lived through greatexperiences in this period of political strugg.es

    Another very important deed which is not sufficiently studied isthe question of the guerrillas: in 1965 there was a outbreak ofguerrilla warfare, including this zona. The guerrilla movement inthe country is part of the national process. It is a primaryquestion thaat must be

    In order to conclude this theme we will deal with the followingsome maintain that to hold that bureaucratic capitalism is in thecountry is to ignore its semi-feudal and semi-colonial characterthey say it proposes that the nation is capitalist in a hiddenmanner. This is an error ignores the laws of social development ofour country and of the backwards countries: precisely becausebureaucrat capitalism is no more than the path of imperialism ina semi-feudal and semi-colonial country and without semi-feudal
    Ind semi-colonial conditions there would be no bureaucratcapitalism. Thus, to propose the existence of bureaucrat capitalismis to propose as a premise that the country Is semi-feudal anesemi-coon1a

    democracy, but parliamentarism did not satisfy the needs of theexploiters; the popular masses advanced with relative ease puttirthe exploiting classes in difficult, although temporary, positions
    Thus, they needed to substitute the representative modality,parliamentarism. Was this a typical case that only happened inour country? No. The decade of 1960 implied the fragility

    of a newPolitical establishment for the country.
    Thus, the current regime arises from economic, social, andpolitical necessities ot deepening bureaucratic capitalism
    The plans and characteristics of the regime
    There now exists a socio-economic plan which is little talkedabout. In synthesis it establishes: the need to reinvigoratebureaucratic capitalism, by way of the efforts of workers andpeasants, the former brought about by means of the industrial lawand the others by means of the agrarian law. At the same time it

    this is another thing that is not very clear. The regime,
    sanctioningng its fundamental measures (in agriculture, industand education ) has passed to an organizational stage. Today andin the immediate future we develop within organizationmobilization, and participation that the regime is promoting. The
    Social mobilization must be understood linked to the economicprocess; the same government says that without socialmobilization it will not be able to complete its socio-economicplan, and proposes that the social mobilization has a basis, theparticipation in property ownership. Lately the representatives ofthe regime talk about social property: what does this serve? Thisproperty serves, behind the decoy of participation in propertyownership, to mobilize the masses to the benefit of bureaucraticcapitalism. For this reason the basis of social mobilization is socialparticipation
    What does this social mobilization serve? Social mobilization is apolitical instrument in the hands of the regime to strengthen itsconceptions and open a"neither capitalist nor communist roadthat is, to spread its ideas. Upon spreading its ideas it seeks toavoid that foreign, exotic ideas become embedded in the masseswhat ideas are they refering to? Marxism. This ideologicalProcessis to avoid that the masses earn about Marxism and thus tie themto the bureaucratic capitalist road. Thus, the mobilization is ameans of organizing, startingng from the property modalities, themasses and channel them into a vertical authority. This is whatthey mean by social mobilization; it is a masterpiece of the systemat the service of their economic and political plan. One of the
    reasons w
    the economic plan doesen't advance like they hoped
    it would is the lack of their so-called social mobilization
    From the above, we derive: the current political situation of thecountry is centered around the problem of the mobilization of themasses, now and in the immediate future we move within this

    juncture, which is: who mobilizes and how are the massesmobilized. The government pretends to move them according totheir conception; their actions prove it. The regime aims toorganize the peasant masses. The law 19400 serves this end, and itaims to organize the workers with the so-called CTRP

All of this signifies the intention to organize thee worker,peasant, and student masses, and it reveals that the contention ishappening on and organizational plane.
    Nevertheless, despite the

    period, and that all the regimes and
    P
    Plolitical organizations have
    become invalid in the new social conditions
    From another side, the measures applied in politics, economicsand organizationally truly prove that they are laying theoundations for a CORPORATIST system. The essence of thisquestion are the organizations on different levels, in which the
    Dosses,the workers, and the state should Participate. Three partsin the organizations, which has been defined as a corporationsince the last century. This is the way it has beenProposeed bythose who have upheld corporativism since 1920 and this is theway it is upheld today in Spain and Portugal
    Thus, the current regime is a system that has an idecologicaorientation of a fascist bent and is laying the foundations for aCORPORATIST system. It will be said that here is another thesis
    It is very clear. There is a thesis that says that this is not certain
    8that we are dealing with a revolutionary
    ourgeois regimethat is completing a stage of the revolution; if
    we recall what we have seen this is a position without a politicalideological, or economic basis. Another thesis maintains that it isa bourgeois reformist regime, that it is applying reforms. Whatare reforms? Reforms are the concessions that the people win withtheir struggles, or they are the by-product of revolution, as Leninsaid. Are the agrarian, industrial, or educational laws concessionsto the people? This is enough to show the inconsistencies of thisthesis

    The October Revolution impacted throughout the world.

    More than 30 years ago enemies tried to deny the Marxist

    How to respond to those impugning him? There is only one roadand it is known: to see the position of Mariategui in Marxistphilosophy, political economy and scientific socialism; that is, toremember his theses about the three parts of Marxism because, byseeing clearly his position on these basic questions, the Marxistbasis of the founder of the Communist Party will be understood
    a)Mariategui and Marxist philosophy. He starts out with eachsociety generating its own philosophy

    outside the material base generating it, but it also reacts upon thatbase. He conceives that the philosophical process confrontsmaterialism or idealism and highlights the materialist basis of
    Marx and, that way, the materialist basis sustaining Marxism. Butthat is not all, to Mariategui, as with the classics, philosophy
    as a
    class character, it is an instrument of the class struggle to conquerpower or to defend what has been conquered. Even more. he
    that philosophy follows the direction of the class
    generating it; that way bourgeois philosophy by necessity followsthe road and development of the bourgeoisie. And, as result, tohim philosophy is product of social practice
    He considers Marxist philosophy to be the product of a longdevelopment, the culmination of classical Geherman philosophy,mainly Hegel'ss he accurately points out: "but this affiliiation doesnot imply any servitude by Marxism to Hegel or his philosophywhich, according to the well known sentence, Marx set right-sideup ..marx's materialist conception is born, dialectically, as theantithesis of Hegel's idealist conception. "But even reiteratin8many times the dialectical character of Marxist philosophy, itimpinges upon the essential of dialectics as the unity and strusg8of opposites without falling into mechanistic pitfalls, clearlyestablishing, foor example, the relationship between base andsuperstructure, that whether one or the other will be the mainaspect depends of the concrete conditions. The astute use ofdialectics is, precisely, one of the hallmarks of the theory andpractice of Mariategul
    Particularly important is his position regarding historicalmaterialism which, by the scientific development it implies, heholds to be"a method of historical interpretation of todayssociety; and his proposition conceiving the base, the support of

    thee economic fac
    entails, equally, the key to all other phases of the history of the
    Republic and "economics does not explain, probably, the totalityof a phenomenon and its consequences. But it explains its roots
    He conceives economics, the social relations of exploitation, asroot of the political processes; but he sees
    e economv of a
    country within the international economic system, not as anisolated thing. From that viewpoint, he analyzes economics in itspolitical function to find the laws governing the class struggle in acountry; a task especially carried out in our country by analyzingthe direction historically followed by our economy, the agrarianproduction relations, industrialization and other economic terms,all with one goal: to establish the general laws of the Peruvianrevolution
    Imperialism merited special attention according to Mariategui; butaside from its economic character he emphasized its reactionaryolitical character
    Pointing out that once"the stage of
    monopolies and imperialism arrives, the entire liberal ideolocorresponding to the free competition stage is no longer valid
    This great thesis is identical to that proposed by Lenin
    Concerning imperialism, he also emphaashe

He showed how industrialization in thebackwards nations is tied to and develops as a function of theimperialist powers, in the case of Peru Yankee imperialism. Hsaw clearly how imperialism does not allow the backwards nationsto develop a national economy nor independent industrialization,how on top of their semi-feudal base monopoly capitalism isinstalled, linked to the feudal landowners and generating amercantile bou

    nationalizations; so the question is to see who has benefittedfrom the nationalizations, and that is decided by which classcontrols power. In light of this, who has benefitted from thenationalizations of the current government?
    b)Mariategui and scientific socialism. He starts by distinguishingbetween old social-democratic reformism andmilitant Socialism,pointing out that the difference is that the former" wants toachieve socialism by collaborating politically with the bourgeelsiewhile the latter ones, Marxists, " want to achieve socialism bwholly confiscating political power for the proletariat. "The matterdelimited, he firmly takes thele position ofthe Communist
    International, of the followers of Lenin, in whom he recognizes agreat leader of the international communist movement, declaringhimself Marxist-leninist
    Another point of scientific socialism important to Mariategui isthe crisis of bourgeois democracy whose symptoms could beperceived before World War I and whose causes he sees in'the

    destined to exacerbate the contemporary crisis, to undermine thebasis of bourgeois society
    To Mariategui, as he taught in The Biology of Fascismof his
    worck The ContemporaryScene. fascism is aPolitical process
    which for many years did not want to call itself or function as aparty, whose social composition is heterogeneous and in whichthe national flag covers up all the contraband and equivocationsin doctrine and program..They want to monopolize patriotism
    But within this "the contradictions undermining fascist unitalways develop, contradictions which first faced "two antitheticsouls and two antithetic mentalities. One extremist or archreactionary fraction proposing the integral insertion of the fascistrevolution in the Statute of the Kingdom of Italy. The neoliberal
    State had, in its view, to be replaced by the fascist State. While arevisionist fraction instead called for a more or less extensivepolitical rectification; a contradiction which, resolving itselfavorably towards the first tendency, did not therefore cease toexist but continued to develop under new forms: one tendencproposing to sweep away "all opponents of the fascist regime in a

    lers more Intellectual, bu
    no less apocalyptical.. invited fascism to definitively liquidate thearliamentary regime, meanwhile the theoreticians of integralfascism sketch the technique of the fascist State which it conceivesalmost as a vertical trust of workers' unions or corporations
    Thus, fascism is masterfully presented, essentially analyzed evenin its contradictions
    Furthermore, in his analysis of fascism Mariategui advances totypify the characteristic attitude of a reformist, of a democrat,however one tormented by a series of 'doubts about democracand of unsettled feelings respect to reform shown by Englishwriter H G. Wells regarding Mussolini's regime: "Fascism appearsto him a cataclysm, more than a consequence and result of the128

    bankruptcy of bourgeois democracy and the defeat of theroletarian revolution in Italy. A confirmed evolutionist, Wells
    Pcannot conceive of fascism as a phenomenon possible within the
    logic of history. He must understand it as an exceptionalphenomenon. "To reformism, as we can see, fascism is not theconsequence of the crisis of bourgeois democracy but " anexception, a cataclysm, which is how some see it today in ourcountry, only and exclusively as terror on the march, not seeing it
    phenomenon possible within the logic of history" caused by
    The develodment of the monopolies into imperialism and thequestioning ofthe bourgeoisie by the proletariat. Let that thesishelp us to reject the reformist concepts being propagated aboutfascism and to have a correct and necessary understanding ofhistory and the current situation in our count
    Other problems of scientific socialism set forth by Mariategui arethe violent revolution, the role of the proletariat and of the Part
    On these he maintained: The revolution is the Painful gestatione

    Let's analyze this substantial problem, whether openly or covertly;130

    LET US RETAKE MARIATEGU
    the destiny of our country depends on the position we take in thi
    regar
    a)The character of Peruvian Society. Lets start from the words ofthe founder of the Communist Part
    Capitalism develops within a semi-feudal country like ours; attimes in which, having reached the monopolyand Imperialsstage, the entire liberal ideolo
    corresponding to the frree
    competition stage has ceased to be valid. Imperialism does nottolerate an economic
    rogram of nationalization and
    P
    industrialization in any of those semi-colonial nations it exploitsas markets for its commodities and capital, and as sources of rawmaterials. It forces them into specialization, to monoculture (in
    Peru petroleum, copper, sugar, cotton ) suffering a permanentcrisis of manufactured products, a crisis derived from this rigidletermination of national production, by factors of the capitalistworld market
    In these words which belong to point III of the Party Program
    e semi-feudal and semi-colonial character of our society isestablished. The first one, semi-feudalism, surelyly must not besought in the subsistence of institutions and political or judiciforms of the feudal order. Formally Peru is a republican anddemocratic bourgeois State. Feudalism or semi-feudalism survivesin the structure of our agrarian economy, " said Mariategui. Wesee it today, despite the years elapsed, because it persists and neworms of semi-feudal roots are developed, forms of unpaidaboramily obligations and deferred salariespersonal privileges,maintenance and fusion of old latifundia and the preponderanceof gamonalismo, under cover of new conditions and highsounding words. Semi-feudalism, harshly attacked in years pasthas developed into a self-evident truth, since the class stru.ggitself, with the rural explosion we have seen so many times, the
    131

==========第131页==========
    COLLECTED WORKS OF PCP-VOLUME 1(1968-1987
    Agrarian reforms and the counter-revolutionary action we haveseen since the 1960s, show the semi-feudal base of Peruviansociety
    With respect to semi-colonialism, Mariategui maintained that acountry can be politically independent while its economycontinues to be dominated by imperialism; Furthermore, hefirmly maintained that South American countries like ours areolitically independent, economically colonized. And thatsituation continues to develop; our economy sutters growing andiversified imperialist and social-imperialist penetration, directand indirect. The semi-colonial situation has been questioned inrecent years, by affirming without proot that Peru has become acolony, since that is what is affirmed when one
    Pifies the
    country as a"neocolony and that affirmation reaches an extremewhen it is proposed that we are a"neocolony, but ruled byabourgeois reformist government
    The quotedparagraph proposeed that capitalism develops in Perubut it is a capitalism subjected to the control mainly of NorthAmerican imperialism, not a capitalism that allows a nationaleconomy and independent industrialization; but
    luite the9
    opposite, a capitalism subservient to the imperialist metropolis
    Which does not tolerate a true national economy serving our
    nation, nor independent industrialization. Thus, Mariategui doesnot deny capitalist development in the country, but specifies ourtype of capitalism; capitalism in a semi-feudal country Iivng Ithe age of monopolies and political reaction, a capitalism thatwhile it develops it increases our semi-colonial condition: acapitalism engendering a comprador bourgeoisie linked to U. Simperialism. In summary, a bureaucratic capitalism from theviewpoint of Mao Tse-tung
    That is the valid and current understandinng Mariategui had about132

==========第132页==========
    LET US RETAKE MARIATEGU
    the character of Peruvian society. Later studies and research onlconfirmed and specified the accurate theses sustained by our
    ounder
    b)The two stages of the Peruvian revolution. Starting from thecountrys semi-colonial and semi-feudal condition, Mariateguianalyzed the revolutionary forces concluding that there are twobasic classes: the proletariat and the peasantry. Althhough the latters the main force, being the m
    ng the majority, and supports the weight of
    semi-feudalism, the formerthe working class, is the leading classfurther on, he noted that only with thee appearance o
    e
    roletariat can the peasantry fulfill its role: Socialist doctrine ise only one capable of giving a modern, constructive sense to theindigenous cause, which, placed in the true social and economicarena, and elevated to the level of a realistic and creative policcounts for the fulfillment of this enterprise with the will anddiscipline of a class now making its appearance in our historicapolitical process: The proletariat
    Joining the peasantry and the proletariat is the petty-bourgeoisie
    whic
    Ways played a very minor and disoriented role n Feru
    put under pressure by foreign capitalism "it appears destined toassume, as its organization and orientation prospersrevolutionary nationalist attitude. These are the driving classes ofthe revolution, who under certain conditions and circumstancescan be joined by the national bourgeoisie, which Mariategui callsthe "left bourgeoisie. "Those are the four classes who united aimat the targets of the revolution Semi-feudalism and imperialism
    In two well known paragraphs of the Communist Party Program,written by the founder himself, the stages of the Peruvianrevolution are defined and its character specified
    The emancipation of the economy of the country is only possible
    133

==========第133页==========
    COLLECTED WORKS OF PCP-VOLUME 1(1968-1987
    through the action of the proletarian masses, in solidarity with theworld's anti-imperialist struggle. Only the action of the proletariatcan first stimulate and later on carry out the tasks of thebourgeois-democratic revolution which the bourgeois regime itself
    IS Incapable of fulfilling
    The bourgeois-democratic stage accomplished, the revolutionbecomes, in its obiectives and doctrine, a proletarian revolution
    The party of the proletariat, qualified by the struggle to exercisepower and develop its own program,fulfills in this stage the tasksof organizing and defending the socialist order
    Here we see the problem of the Peruvian revolution and its stagesmasterfully condensed: The national-democratic or bourgeodemocratic of the new kind in the wording of Mao Tse-tung, anthe proletarian revolution. Two stages, the first one which we areliving in since 1928, but which still has not been fulfilled orconcluded, and the future, proletarian stage; two uninterruptedstages of the same revolutionary process. Under no circumstancesshould their character and contents be confused. This great thesis
    Mariategui became, after broad debates and struggles, afundamental truth of Marxist understanding of the laws of our
    revolution
    But if this is fundamental, then it is even more so that the
    workin
    ass and on
    the working class through its party is
    capable of leading the national-democratic revolution. That onlyby preparing and organizing within the national-democratic
    revolution can it
    develop the second, proletarian stage
    Consequently, if the national-democratic revolution is not led bythe working class, in no way can it be completed, much less buildsocialism. This is the paramount question today, since counterrevolution and social corporativism deny this great truth andassert that in our country the armed forces of the old State is134

    fulfilling the first stage of the revolution and even, they claimlaying the foundations for socialism. This key questiondifferentiates revolutionaries from counter-revolutionaries: Thefirst ones, with Marxism and Mariategui, maintain that theproletariat and only the proletariat can first stimulate and lateron fulfill the tasks of the bourgeois-democratic revolution whichthe bourgeois regime is incapable to develop and fulfill. That isour position. We must uphold and fight the counter-revolutionarytheses, aiming our spear against social-corporativist revisionismthat preaches against the thesis of Mariategui and is thedetachment of social-imperialism in our country, whose effortsserve only its collusion and collision with the Yankee superpowerfor world domination
    c) The anti-feudal struggle. The land program is basic to ourcountry and, in synthesis, it is the question of feudalism with itstwo elements Latifundia and servitude; that is why, as Mariategui
    said, the agrarian problem in Peru is the destruction of feudalism
    whose relations taint our society from top to bottom, from thebase to the superstructure. The motor of rural struggles has beenand is the land question, and that the three agrarian laws of the1960s did not destroy its base is clearly shown by today'sstruggles by thee peasan
    In analyzing the land question, the founder of the Partyighlighted the struggle confronting community and latifundiate showed its economic and social superiority, poiting out thatthe community had given the peasant majorities strength to resistthe thievery by feudal landowners throughout the centuries, andthat it entails thee living yereast which will help socialistdevelopment in the future. Reviewing the agrarian labor regimee

    iscover its blurred semi-feudal essence hidden behind theapparent and purported destruction of feudalism"of the so-called
    agrarian reform
    Considering the struggles of the Peruvian and of Latin Americaneasantry generally, Mariategui brought forward the slogan of thepeasants: "Land for those who till it, expropriate them withoutcompensation "and that their mobilization demands the "armin8of workers and peasants to conquer and defendtheir ga
    ans
    n
    that way, feudalism must be destroyed by confiscating the landsand only thete armed workers and peasants will be able toaccomplish this, since there is no other way to breakfeudalism, destroy latifundia and abolish serfdom. We must notforget that Peruvian laws have been ruling agrarian relations andabolishing serfdom for over 150 years, but in reality they havemaintained the underling feudalism
    Consequently, the anti-feudal struggle is the motive of the classstruggle in the countryside and the basis of our nationaldemocratic revolution itself
    C)The anti-imperialist struggle. Peru, like the rest of the LatinAmerican countries, is a nation in a formative stage. "It is beingbuilt over the inert indigenous strata, and the alluvial sedimentsof western civilization. In that way, "the problem of the Indiansis the problem of four million Peruvians. It is the problem ofthree fourths of the population of Peru. It is the problem of themaiority. It is the problem of nationality, Mariategui observedand he added: "A truly national Poolicy cannot do without the
    Indian, it cannot ignore the Indian. The Indian is the foundationof our nationality in formation. Oppression makes the Indian anenemy of civility. It annuls them, practically, as an element ofprogress. Those who impoverish and depress the Indian,impoverish and depress the nation. Without thee Indian, the136

    LET US RETAKE MARIATEGU
    condition of being Peruvian is not possible. This truth ought to bevalid, above all, to persons of mere demo-liberal bourgeois andnationalist ideology
    Thus, the problem of the Indian is that of the majority ignored bythe policies of the Peruvian State, of the republic generally, for
    morethan 150 years; it is the problem of acting outside the
    interest of four fifths of the population. As our founder said, oflooking and acting with eyes aimed at the imperialist metropolisaminating us. Digging deeper Into
    Ito the problem, Mariategui set
    forth that the Indian problem is the problem of the landconsequently, the national question Is based onthee land questionand in no way can one be separated from the other, a proposalwhich follows strictlythe these; of Marxism, proved by thepractice of the class struggle of our own masses and expressedincontrovertibly, in the character of our revolution
    On this basis, the founder of the Communist Party analyzed theclasses and the anti-imperialist struggle in our country, and in
    Latin America in general; he pointed out that the Latin American
    gelsie fee sure enouth of their ownership ofg
    Power So as
    not to care much about national sovereignty, as well as havingcommon interests with imperialism, addingthat: Whileimperialist policy.is not forced to resort to armed interventionin case of military occupation they will count on the absolutecollaboration of the bourgeoisie. In that way the relationship ofthe Peruvian"mercantile bourgeoisie "and itsPosition witithrespect to imperialism was clarified. Referring to our country,when treating the subject of the united front, Mariategui proposene possibility of uniting"with the left liberal bourgeoisie, truldisposed to struggle against the remnants of feudalism and against
    Imperialspenetration, defining the position of what today we
    call the national bourgeoisie; and he specified, besides, as we sawthat the petty-bourgeoisie will go on developing "a revolutionary

    On the other hand, charginagainst the Apristas who had raised

    anti-imperialism to the level of a program, a political attitude, amovement that is an end in Itself and led spontaneously, due towhat process we don't know, whether socialism or the socirevolution"and exposing their thesis of" we are leftists (orsocialists )because we are anti-imperialist " Mariategui, keeping inmind that only the proletariat, together with the peasantry, can beconsistently anti-imperialist
    Pjointed out: For us. anti
    imperialism does not constitute, nor can it constitute by itself, aolitical program, a mass movement capable of conqueringower, and he concluded: In conclusion, we are anti-imperialistsbecause we are socialists, because we are revolutionaries, becausewe counterpoise socialism as an opposite system to capitalism,destined to replace it, because in the struggle against foreignimperialism we fulfill our duties of solidarity
    ith the
    revolutionary masses of the world
    Thus, the anti-feudal and anti-imperialist struggle intermingle astwo inseparable matters and as integral parts of the nationaldemocratic revolution which only the working class is capable ofleading, provided it establishes the worker-peasant alliance as thestarting point of the united front of the revolution
    The united front. Seeing the basic problems of the character of

    1st, 1924. He pointed out that"we are still too few to divideourselves and the many common tasks pending in the service ofthe class. He was a consistent defender of the united front. hedemanded it as a solidarity action, concrete and practical for thosewho, without getting ideologically confused, "must feel themselvesunited by class solidarity, linked by the common struggle againstthe common adversary, linked by the same revolutionary will andhe same renewing passion s and after recognizingthat thevare
    of tendencies and the diversity of ideological shades is
    Inevitable in

    demanded: " What matters is that those groups and thosetendencies to know how to understand each other before theconcrete reality of the day. So they do not crash like Byzantines inmutual excommunications and ex-confessions. That they do notalienate the masses from the revolution, by a big show of thedogmatic quarrels of their preachers. That they dont use theirweapons or waste their time in hurting each other, but in fightingthe old social order, its institutions, its injustices and its crimes
    These words resound alive today as thee current order, demandingto unite so as to fulfill the common"historic duties"of developinsclass consciousness and the feeling of the class, of sowing andspreading and renovatingclass ideas, to wrest the workers awayom the false institutions claiming to represent them; to figlrepression and the corporativist offensive, to detend

    On that basis Mariategui proposed forming the

    and anti-feudal front which under the leadership of the workingclass and based on the workers and peasants alliance could unite
    workers and peasants, the petty-bourgeoisie and, under certainconditions and circumstances, the "bourgeois left, which we now

    evelope
    aseed on the worker-peasant alliance and led by the
    proletariat, not by the bourgeoisie or the petty-bourgeoisie. In thisfront, the working class, through its Party, enters into an alliancewith other classes. But in any event it will give the proletariat
    of criticism, of action, of the press and of
    organization. "There we have the politics of the united front andthe independent class politics which the Party must never
    abandon
    On the other hand, Mariategui highlighted that when confronted
    a revolutionaury threat the bourgeoisie also forms a unitedont, but only temporarily, only while a detinite assault on therevolution is prepared. Afterwards each one of the bourgeoisroups tries to recover its autonomy .. Within the bourgeoisiethere are contrasts of ideolo
    and interests, contrasts which no
    one can suppress; that way, the bourgeois block is necessitroken by the development of its own internal contradictions andthe development of thele class struggle
    These theses, verified by reality, also demand overcomingsectarianism, which today is badily generalize

    We must struggle for unification, today more than ever, since
    reactionanry policy will ultimately cause the polarization of the
    efts. It will provoke the fusion of all proletarian forces. Thecapitalist counter offensive will achieve what the instinct of theworking classes has been unable to do: The united proletarianfront: "We are fighting against a fascist government which carries

    political sector, with which I will never reach an understanding isanother thing: That of mediocre reformism, of domesticatedsocialism, or with the democracy of pharisees
    f The military problem. Not much is said about Mariategui'stheses on the military problem, moreover it is believed he neverexpounded on such an important question: on the contrary, in hisworks the importance Mariategui gave to revolutionary violencewar and military organization is notable. Already by 1921 hewrote: "there is no such thing as a measured, even, soft, sereneplacid revolution; in 1923: power is conquered through violence
    。。On
    rouIgh dictatorship is power preserved";in 1925: " Whil
    reaction is the instinct of conservation, the agony of the pastrevolution is thle painttul gestation, the bloody birth of thepresent; and in 1927: "if revolution demands violence, authority,discipline, I am for violence, authority, discipline. I accept themas a whole with all their horrors without cowardly reservations
    The thesis of revolutionary violence, therefore, is a constanttheme of his theou
    nght, thheses that are hidden by opportunism and
    which as Marxists we must raise firmly and consequent
    But this is not his entire understanding of the revolution, which isconceived and defined as protracted: A revolution is not a coupd'etat, nor an insurrection, it is not one of those things here wecall a revolution by the arbitrary use of that word. A revolutiontakes many years to be fulfilled. Frequently it has alternate periodswhen revolutionary forces are dominant and then whencounterrevolutionary torces predominate. Just like a war is a
    Process of offensives and counter-offensives. of victories anddefeats, as long as one of the conflicting sides does not finallysurrender, as long as it does not resign from the fight, it is notvanquished. Its defeat is temporary but not total. According tothis interpretation of history, reaction, white terror are butepisodes in the class struggle

    ere we have
    the theses that must guide us
    Besides, Mariategui establishes the relationship between politicsand war, he derives the weakness of the military front from thepolitical weakness, and military strength also as a politicalproduct: " Because, that way, in this as in the rest of world war, asthee rest of Its great aspects,the political factors, the moraleactors,the psychological factors had more importance than
    Ps
    purely military factors. So, war follows politics. He understood,as our tounder, that revolution generates an army oof the new typewith its own tasks and different from the armies of the exploiters
    The red army is a new case in the worlds military history, it isan army which feels its role as a revolutionary army and whichdoes not forget that its aim is the defense of the revolution. Anyspecific and militarily imperialist feeling is by necessity excludedrom its soul. Its discipline, its organization and its structure arerevolutionary. "Here we have the army of the new type which therevolution generates and which can only arise under the absolutecontrol of the Party, as Mao Tse-tung teaches
    Finally, Mariategui paid special attention to the Mexican
    Revolution in Latin America and the Chinese Revolution in Asiahighlighting in both their national-democratic character, theiragrarian roots, the role of the peasantry and the vital participationof the working class, while at the same time highlighting thecontrary works of imperialism and of the bourgeoisie whichbetrayed or trafficked with the revolution
    Starting

    proposed arming peasants and workers to conquer and defend it,arming the masses of peasants and workers to carry forward the

    national-democratic revolution. He highlighted its development asa peasant's revolution which advances from the countryside andwhich develops in revolutionary actions, in montoneras armedgroup of masses in the Andes-trans, joined together by thesolidarity of soldiers and officers in"organic unity, in whose veinscirculates the same blood in montoneras ioined to the masseswith the same solidarity relations existing within them: the samerelationship of body, of class, existed within the montonera andthe workers and peasants masses. The montoneras simply werethe most active, warlike and dynamic part of the masses
    Evidently when Mariategui wrote those words about the Sovietguerrillas which in the 1920s fought in Siberia against thereactionaries, he thought of the montoneras in our country and
    Latin America; and in doing so he described and revealed for usthe essential relationship between guerrillas and the masses of thepeople, its undetachable unity, the guerrilla condition of beingthe most active, warlike and dynamic part of the massesintegral part of the masses and never an action separate fromem
    These points make up Mariategui's thought about the militaryproblem besides his basic thesis that peasant uprisings cannottriumph on their own and if ever they triumphed it was under theleadership of the old bourgeoisie. But today, in the age ofimperialism, and precisely in our America, where"the bourgeoisielas not known how or wanted to fulfill the tasks of liquidatingfeudalism, where "a close descendant of the Spanish conquerors,it has been impossible for it to appropriate the rights and gains ofthe peasant masses, "it corresponds to the proletariat and only theroletariat. to

    Listorical goal of the working class. In that way, the party is theresult of the development of the class struggle in our country andof the appearance, development and maturity of our proletariatis a need of the logical development of our history, of theexistence of classes, of the existence of the working class andtherefore, in no way can it be considered superfluous, quite thecontrary, it is the main and indispensable instrument for the

    strenoth. Universal suffrage may

    Party, which is a class Party with more than hundred and fiftparliamentary votes, are enough to assure torthem organizing acabinet, but does not authorize them to exclude from this cabinetthe bankers and industrialists, unless it opts for a revolutionaryroad. "That way, to Mariategui the Party is not electoral nor can itfollow parliamentary cretinism, parliamentarism is a politicalorganization of the bourgeoisie iust as much as the corporativistmodes of organization. Therefore, for the Party the question is toorge itself as a system of organizations, as a war machine forthe conquest ofPower

    Once again, the founding of the Communist Party is thefulfillment of Mariategui's theoretical and practical struggle and ofhis direct participation in the class struggle, it was his greatcontribution and service to the proletariat, over more than 30rears of combat in our contemporary history, which sustained theappearance and development of the PCP. In contributing to thebuilding of our Party, Mariategui gave it the ideological-political

    Consequently, we must understand the written work of
    Mariategui as part of the construction and political-ideologicalfoundation of the Party
    Jose Carlos Mariategui, our founder, crowned his struggle for the
    Party with his Theses of Affiliation to the III( Third
    International, an important text that must be remembered
    le Communists of the Party adhere to the Third Internationaland agree to work to obtain that same adhesion from the groupswhich form the Party. The ideology we adopt is revolutionary andmilitant Marxism, a doctrine we accept in all its aspectsphilosophical, political and social-economical. The methods weendorse are those of orthodox revolutionary socialism. We notonly reject, but fight by all means and in all its forms the methodsand tendencies of social-democracy of the Second International
    The Party is a class Party and therefore repudiates any tendencyimplying fusion with political forces and organizations of theother classes. The Party recognizes that, within nationalconditions, reality will impose upon us pacts and alliances, usuallwith the revolutionary petty-bourgeoisie; but in any event it willwin for the proletariat freedom of criticism, of action, of the pressand of organization
    Here, we have a document edited by Mariategui and which hehimself presented to the Central Committee on 1st March 1930and approved on following March 4th; this document is enoughto topple so much anti-party phrase-mongering which today doesnot deserve to be considered
    Finally, lets recall that to Mariategui: " Parties are not born out ofsome academic little council"and that the Party"is not andcannot be a peaceful and unanimous academy; but the Party is

    Mariategui's thought
    h)The mass line. Along with all that has been exposed we seehow at the bottom of all these proposals there is a position, themass line, a basic question in Mariategui's thought, which is littleknown. It suffices to highlight here that Mariategui considers thatthe presence of the masses fills contemporarytimes. that themultitudes, as he says, are the main actors today. The working
    class
    lave a myth, a goal--social revolution, a goal which theproletariat upholds and marches towards, with"an active anevehement faith, in contrast to the bourgeois skepticism anddecadence. The masses fight for the final struggle"sure of theirvictory and he says: "The sentence in Eugene Portiers song(The

    which work to create a new order"and to which we must serveand interpret, since individuals and leaders are judged accordingto "how well they have been able to serve and interpret the
    revolutionary masses
    However
    Mariategui always emphasizes that the masses
    ultimately are the basic masses, the workers and peasants: theforce of the revolution always resided in the alliance betweenworkers and agrarians, that is of the workers and peasantsmasses, "as he says speaking of the Mexican Revolution; thatbefore them opportunism is manifested by"'trusting more thepossibility of exploiting the contradictions and rivalries amongchiefs than in the possibility of carrying the masses towards clearrevolutionary politics, andthat the Mexican strugs

    P
    show the definite position of Mariategui with respect to
    the masses, in whose struggles he considers that Marxism is alive
    Marx lives in the struggle tor the realization of socialism wagedby innumerable multitudes animated by his doctrines throughoutthe world
    What is said does not imply thee negation o
    e importance o
    leaders in the

    reiterate, are measured by the identification with the interests ofthe revolutionary classes and service rendered to them, mainly tothe proletariat, the class that generates a new tvpe of thinkin8and acting person. With respect to the acts of revolutionaries,
    Mariategui demanded taking into account the class struggle in themind of the individual: " Decadence and revolution coexist in thesame world and also in the same individual. The conscience . . isthe fighting arena of a struggle between the two spirits, the
    understanding of this struggle, sometimes, almost invariable

    one remains strangled on the arena. While speaking of the herohe stated: "the hero always arrives at the goal blooded and tornonly through this price can we wholly pay for his heroismnoticing that the struggle always leaves its marks; finally stating
    Today like yesterday a political order cannot be changed withoutindividuals resolved to resist jail or exile and, to a revolutionary,a prison is merely a work-related accident
    Mariategui's mass line meritt our attention, more so today whenthe basic problem becomes the arena of a battle larger andincreasing each day. Let's keep in mind today, more thaan ever, thetollowing: 'the masses demand unity. The masses want faith
    Their souls reject the corroding voice, the dissolving andpessimistic voice of those who deny and who doubt. They seelthe optimist and cordial voice, youthful and fruitful, of those whoaffirm and who believe
    i)Other aspects of Mariateguis line. All the above confirms thebasic points of the general political line of Mariategui about the
    Peruvian revolution: but that is not his entire work. The founderof the Communist Party, from the viewpoint of the working classand in function of the revolutionary transformation of our
    Peruvian society, set specific political lines for work in trade andindustrial unions, among workers, feminist, youth, teachers anintellectual groups, and other working fronts. Theese Specificolicies are the basis to develop a class line in each front of themass work; also the question in them is to Retake Mariategui's
    Road and develop it according to the present circumstances in the
    class struggle.
    j)Mariategui set the general political line of the Peruvianrevolution. It follows clearly that Mariategui, systematizing theexperience of struggle of the working class and the people of
    Peru, establishedthrougthis direct theoretical and practical150

    Peruvian revolution, as well as the specific political class line inthe various fronts of the mass work. All this can be considered

    building of a new society in our nation, socialism as therevolutionary transformation towards the classless society, the

    Mariategui's Road has an axis: The Communist Party, withoutwhich there can be no revolution or genuine successes for thepeople. The Communist Party, the organized vanguard of theproletariat, is needed so the working class can lead, since only it,through its vanguard, is able to lead the national-democraticrevolution and sustained by the worker-peasant alliance fulfill thefirst stage of the Peruvian Revolution so that, with theictatorship of the proletariat, it can develop into the secondstage, that of the proletarian revolution
    So the decisive question in our revolution, today more than everis to Retake Mariategui's Road and to develop it in the midst ofthe class struggle of the masses today to serve the working class,the people and the revolution

    of the Communist Party was the product of a sha
    struggle and sets a fundamental milestone in the process o
    Mariategui's Road. However the struggle which Jose Carlos
    Mariategui waged was not only outside the ranks of the Party, butalso within its ranks where he struggled to keep it adhering to
    Marxism-leninism and the Communist International
    Quite soon, almost immediately after his death,
    a whole
    opportunist line developed which treacherously began to speakabout the proletarianization and improvement of Mariateguiwhile outside Party ranks the"Aprista criticism

    Mariategui as intellectualized and a Europeanizerwith theveiled purpose of denying his line and destroying the Party. Bythe early 1940s, questions surfaced concerning Mariategui's
    Marxist foundation, though hypocritically, they recognized itsgreat quality. Later on Del Prado and company, while callingthemselves disciples of Mariategui, made an'inoffensive iconout of him, whom they enveloped in frankincense whilerenouncing his Road. That is how an entire period of denying andquestioning Mariategui and his Road evolved; heowever

    1960s in our country implied the sharpening of the class struggland a great rise in the movement of the masses, especially of thepeasantry. The country experienced the deepening of bureaucraticcapitalism, still going on; the workers carried out large strikemovements and increased affiliation to their unions; the peasantryspontaneously carried forward, most of the time, conquering theland with their own actions and an unending wave of landoccupations shook the entire country. The petty-bourgeoisieespecially teachers and students, became more and more involvedin the peoples struggles. At the same time, the demo-liberalparliamentary order entered a crisis, as in other parts of America,and its political parties, its reactionary political parties entered afierce battle to gain positions and reap privileges. This confrontedreaction with the need to fulfill two tasks: To deepen bureaucraticcapitalism, taking the State as the main economic leverage, andthe corporate remodelinggof Peruvian society so as to overcomethe crisis of bourgeois parliamentarism. These are the conditionsand the cause of the rise of the current fascist regime and thetasks the exploiting classes and imperialism have charged it withfulfilling, when they saw the dangers of the questioning of theirorder entailed by the rise in the struggles of thee masses, onechapter of which was the guerrilla struggle, which containedimportant future lessons for the people
    In the midst of these conditions and sharpening struggle,
    e
    theoretical and practical action of the communists developed, the
    Peruvian Marxist-leninists, who, taking Mao Tse-tung Thoughtand its wise teachings, battled to Retake Mariategui's Road and
    Reconstitute his Party. In January 1964, the PCP expelled from itsranks the revisionist clique of Del Prado and company, a factwhich established a milestone in the long road of the Party; thatway at the IV Conference a step was given to adhere to Marxismunder the guidance of Mao Tse-tung Thought. Another point ofadvance was the V Conference, in November 1965, which
    153

    COLLECTED WORKS OF PCP-VOLUME 1(1968-1987
    centered its attention in the understanding of our society and its
    ety
    revolution, getting us closer yet to Mariateguis line. Otheerimportant moments in Retaking Mariategui and Reconstituting
    His Party were the successful struggles the Communist Partywaged against a right opportunist line masquerading as leftistwhose crowning point was the VI Conference, in January 1969 anevent in which the Party formalized its reconstitution startinfrom the Basis of Party Unity, Marxism-leninism-mao Tse-tung
    Thought, and Mariategui's thought and thegenerapolitical line,whose cornerstone is Mariategui; a reconstitution which, as wassanctioned, implied reconstituting the Party for the Peoples War
    That is how the long period of searching for Mariategui's
    Thought was fulfilled, opening up the stage of: Retaking
    Mariategui's Road, "one of whose stages is the reconstitution ofle Party, as a basic and necessary question
    However, the struggle did not end there but is constant. The riseof the current fascist regime and its counter-revolutionaryrogram impacted our ranks by generating a liquidationist rightopportunist line, which aimed dangerously against the life of the
    Party itself. This struggle had as milestones the II Plenum of the
    Central Committee, which characterized the struggle againstliquidationist opportunism, and called to fight against it, andIII Plenum of the Central Committee "ON RECONSTITUTIONwhich corroborated the defeat of liquidationism and set thpolitical, organizational and mass work basis for the function ofthe reconstitution of the Party. That way, an ever betterperspective to the fulfillment of its historic mission opened up forthe Party of Mariategui. Finally, the VI Plenum of the PCP
    Central Committee, under the slogan of" FULLY RETAKE

    The relevance of Mariategui Thought. We saw how in the1960s Mariategui's thinking went on establishing itself more andmore firmly; however in that period, in which we still live, interestfor Mariategui grows, inside and outside the country. At the sametime, we see a denial of Mariategui on two levels: Some attack anddeny the Marxist bases of Mariategui thiIn King, and others denyits relevance. Those questioning its Marxist bases contend theideological base sustaining it is irrational idealism and theconcepts predominating in western philosophical thought, mainly
    European. Once Mariategui's theses about Marxist philosophy,olitics economics and scientific socialism are set forth. theseobservations need not be analyzed any further; it suffices toreiterate that the Marxist character of the bases of Mariategui aresufficiently clear, and point out that those impugning it have a thebottom a central argument: The impossibility for Marxism to

    develop in a country with few industrial workers. This startingpoint uncovers an unacceptable mechanical position; for Marxismto appear on a world scale, the development of the working classto the level it had attained in Europe by the mid 19th century wasneeded, and on that material base Marx and Engels created
    Marxism, which from that point on develops vigorously andspreads itself through the five continents. The revolutionaries ofthe backwards countries, where there are immense masses ofpeasants and proportionally a reduced Industrial working class,ound in Marxism an instrument to guide their actions and takinits principles they fused them with specific revolutionaryconditions; in that way, Marxism-leninism fused with theconcrete conditions of the movements of national iberation andtheir democratic revolutions. This was consequently shownincontrovertibly by Mao Tse-tung Thought, as it developed
    Marxism
    A similar case is that of the founder of the Communist Partyof
    Peru. Mariategui also applied Marxism-leninism to a semi-feudaland semi-colonial country, furthermore, he analyzed similarcountries in Latin America; and participating directly in the classstruggle in our country he was able to develop himselfas a
    Marxist and to applythe universal principles creatively, therefore,lere is a similarity between many

    If there is to be a revolution, there must be a revolutionary Party
    Without a revolutionary Party, without a revolutionary Party builton the Marxist-leninist revolutionary theory and in Marxist

    Bolsheviks in leading the October Revolution, in leading socialistconstruction and in defeating fascist aggression that revolutionary
    Parties of the new type were formed and developed in the world
    With the birth of revolutionary parties of this type, the face of theworld revolution has changed. The change has been so great thattransformations utterly inconceivable topeopDle of the oldergeneration have come into being through fire and thunder.Withthe birth of the Communist Party, the face of the Chineserevolution took on an altogether new aspect.

    MARX ENGELS AND THE BUILDING OF THIE PARTY
    Marx and Engels founded the concept of the working class whichis Marxism. They raised solid truths which we cannot abandonsuch as: the principle of class struggle to understand andtransform the world; violence as the midwife of history; thedictatorship of theProletariat and the necessitv of therevolutionary transformation of the old society through a longhistorical process, among others. But also, and at times it is not
    emphasized enouth, Marx and Engels realized their thesis on the
    g
    necessitv oSf buildingthe working class Party as an indispensableinstrument to fight for its class interests. Thus, in the midst ofarduous struggle against old anarchist concepts with a profoundlyourgeols essence, they were able to esta

    Given that the lords of the land and capital always use theirpolitical privileges to defend and perpetuate their economicmonopolies and to subjugate labor, the conquest of politica.
    power has become the great duty of the proletariat (Marx and
    Engels, Collected Works, Vol 23 P. 243)
    Marx and Engels started from the idea that the workerstemselves had to struggle for their own emancipation as a class,and that the economic emancipation of the proletariat is " thegreat end to which every political movement ought to besubordinate as a means. They proposed the need that theworking class has in organizing itself as a political Party tostruggle for its own class interests, to seize power and then,
    consequentntly, reach its goal, the realization of its historic
    obiective: the abolition of classes and the building of a new societwithout exploiters or oppressors
    In the same manner they set forth that the working class organizeitself"into a political Party distinct from, and opposed to, all theold political parties. " This is because thee workin8Class uponorganizing itself into a political Party, does so taking as itssustenance its class consciousness: Marxism. Because it has itsown program, which Marx and Engels set forth in the Manifestowhich makes Communists Doint out and bring to the front thecommon interests of the entire proletariat, independently of allnationality and in which the varying stages of developmentwhich the struggle of the working class and against theourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhererepresent the interests of the movement as a whole. Constanteeding hold of its class consciousness which can be summarizedin this single sentence: Abolition of private property. (Marx and

    P
    In addition to the development of struggle in the Party of theroletariat they conceived the stage of revolution to be connectedwith other oppressed classes. Marx set forth that in Germany theworking class revolution would depend on backing it "with asecond edition of the peasant war, while Engels maintained: " Inan agrarian country, it is vulgar to rise up exclusively against the

    saying anything about the patriarchal exploitation of the sticktohich the rural workers are subjected to by the feudal nobili

    and resovedthe problem of the Party. What has happened is
    that, as in other fields of Marxism, this revolutionary theory andpractice on the necessity of the Party, its construction and the
    P
    struggle of two lines within it, has been developed, synthesizingthe later great experiences of the international working class,efforts which have been accomplished at a global level by Leninand Chairman Mao
    LENIN AND THE BUILDING OF A NEW TYPE OE PARTY
    The twentieth century brought us imperialism as the last anhighest phase of capitalism. Lenin reestablished the old
    revolutionarytheories of Marx and Engels, which the oldrevisionists had tried to destroy, and elevated them to the level of
    Marxism-leninism. What implications does this development of
    Marxism have for the construction of the proletariats Party
    Lenin, conscious that they had reached the stage of seizing powerand of the dictatorship of the proletariat, repeated thee necessitv othe Party to transform society. His great point is shown
    Give us an organization of revolutionaries and well shake Russiato its foundations
    For Lenin, to change the world requires a Party and this has aprogram which, according to his own words, " consists of theorganization of the proletariat's class struggle and
    e eaders
    of this struggle whose final objective is the conquest of politicalpower for the proletariat and the organization of socialist society
    Understanding, like no one else in his time, the necessity of the

    organization of the proletariat in whose organization theirstrength resides, Lenin set forth
    e following principle which no
    Communist can forget
    The Proletariat, in its struggle for power, has no weapon otherthan organization. The proletariat, disunited by
    anarchic
    competition within the bourgeois world, crushed by forced laborat the service of capital, constantly thrown in the abyss of themost complete misery, brutality and degeneration, can onlybecome, and will inevitably become, an invincible force when itsideological union by means of Marxist principles secures itselfthrough the organizations material unity, which gives cohesion tothe millions of workers in the army of the working class. Beforethis army neither the decrepit power of the Russian aristocracynor the decaying power of international capitalism will be able tosustain itself. Each day this army will extend its ranks farther,despite all the zigzags and steps backwards, despite thopportunist phrases of the puppets of contemporary socialdemocracy, despite the fatuous eulogies of the backward circularspirit, despite the tinsel and the intellectuals own anarchistbankruptcy. "( Lenin, Collected Works, Vol 7, p. 415)
    We Communist and revolutionary Peruvians must pay attentionto these words which are today more precious than ever. In themwe reiterate: In the first place, the struggle for power demands theorganization of the proletariat, and its importance is such that itcomposes its only weapon. In the second place, despite all thedifficulties imposed by exploitation, if it takes Marxism as itsguide and base of ideological unity and solidifies it by tighteningtheir ranks in organization, the proletariat will be invincible. Inthe third place, against the organized army of the proletariat thereactionary power will be unable to stay in power in any countrynor will imperialism or social imperialism on a global level. In theourth place, the organized working class will close its ranks more166

    In that manner Lenin set forth the problem of the construction ofthe Party, of its necessity and development in struggle and of itsideological, political and organizational construction
    But this is not all. In One Step Forward, Two Steps Back, Leninset forth the organizational theories of the Party, whose maiesticsummary we take from the old and great History of the
    Communist Party(Bolshevik) of the USSR by Stalin, pp 48-49
    )The Party is a military detachment of the working class, a partf it. But it is a vanguard detachment which goes ahead, whichleads. It is a conscious detachment who knows the laws of therevolutionary process, and it is a Marxist detachment whichfirmly sustains itself in the working classes revolutionary

    4)The Party is the incarnation of the ties that unite thevanguard detachment of the working class with the masses. "Assuch, it will not live or develop separated from thee masses and, onthe contrary, its life and development demand that it"multiply itslinks with the masses and win the masses trust
    5)The Party should be organized along the principle ofdemocratic centralism, with single statutes and with an equaldiscipline for all and "with a single leadership organ at its head, tobe known as the Party congress. And in the intervals between thecongress and the central committees congress, with thesubmission of the minority to the maiori

    6)To maintain unity in its ranks the Party reauires a singlediscipline applicable to all, a unity which demands great attentionbecause, as Stalin would say, "Comrade Lenin gave us the legacyto care for the unity of the Party like children care for theelr eves
    This thesis and the previous ones we should bear in mind as
    Communists and Peruvian revolutionaries. since al of them arevital. Another problem of extraordinary importance discussed by
    Lenin is that of clandestinity, a question which amongst ourselves
    Is confused with hiding, with ostrich policies. Lenin set forth the
    need for a clandestine Party as a system of highkcentralizedorganizations with the goal of being able to constantly count on,all circumstances, with a high
    g
    comman
    capable of leading
    the revolution, maintaining its flags and sticking by them despiterepression and persecution. Thus clandestinity serves so that the
    Party becomes a war machine which will indomitably persevereuntil accomplishing its goal of taking power in order to change168

    ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PARTY
    the world without ever separating itself from the masses. Due tothe necessities of the very struggle in our country we shouldhighlight some points on this complex problem. Here it isparticularly important to have a clear idea of what the art ofconspiratorial organization consists of. Lenin, in his own wordsin Letter To a Comrade On Our Organizational Tasks, a bookletwhich is cited but whose principles are not understood much lessapplied, tells us
    All art of conspiratorial organization should consist of knowinow to use everything and everyone, to give workor ever voneand at the same time maintain the leadership of the entiremovement, not by the force of power it must be understood, butny authority, energy, greater experience and variety of knowledgeand talent. " (Lenin, Vol 6, p. 240)
    In the same booklet, against those who understand clandestinityas something rigid and mechanical, Lenin states
    Besides, the level of clandestinity and the organic form of thediverse circles will depend on the nature of its functions. As suchit follows that the forms of organization shall be the most varied
    epending on
    te type of organization, from the strictest tigl
    and closed to the freest broad, open and with little structure
    Lenin, Vol 6, P. 245
    We consider this question to be of the utmost importance for ourcurrent revolutionary situation as there is, we reiterate, too muchmechanical and non-dialectical thought in considering theseroblems. Lenins theories regarding cl

    The problem of the clandestine Party and the legal work of socialdemocracy within Russia is one of the Partys principal problems

    It occupies the attention of the P.O. S.D. R. during thee entireperiod following the revolution (he refers to 1905)and has givenplace to the most violent struggle within its ranks
    It is around this problem that the struggle of the liquidationistsagainst the anti-liquidationists has developed. The December1908 conference.. focused with clarity on a special resolution, the
    Party's criterion on organizational questions: the Party iscomposed of clandestine social democratic cells who should createpoints of support for work amongst the masses in the form of anet, as broad and branched off as possible, of legal workerssocieties. "(Lenin, Vol 18 p 386)
    And highlighting the relations between legal and clandestine
    work
    The main conclusion of the appreciation which our Party has atthe moment is that Revolution is necessary and getting closer
    The forms of development which lead to revolution have changedbut the old tasks of the revolution continue to stand From therewe draw the following conclusions: the forms of organizationshould change, the cells' should adopt flexible forms in such amanner that their expansion will not occur at the expense of the
    ceIIS themselves but rather of their legal periphery, etc
    But this change of form of the clandestine organization hasnothing to do with the formula of accommodating the legalmovement. It is something completely different! The legal
    organizations are the points of support which allow taking edifyto the
    masses the ideas of clandestine cels. That is to saythat we mthe form of influence to the obiective of which the priorinfluences continue in the sense of clandestine orientation

    itself to the legal. By the content of our Partys work, legal workwill accommodate itself to the clandestine ideas. "(Lenin, Vol. 18
    P.392)
    And finally
    The social democratic Party is clandestine in its entirety, in eachone of its cells and, what is of greatest substance, by the entirecontent of its work whichProdoses and
    Prepares for
    e
    revolution. Because of this, the most open work of the most opencells cannot be had as the open work of the Party. (Lenin, Vol
    18,P.393-4)
    This citation is lengthy but we consider it to be ofgreatimportance for all revolutionary work in our country and itdeserves special attention as does the preceding on clandestinewor
    In our countryit is common to think that clandestine worseparates us from the masses. But we shall recall what Lenin saidwith regard to this
    "But Sverdlov. this always
    rofessional revolutionary, did not
    P
    become separated from the masses for even a moment. When theconditions of czarism condemned him to carry out exclusivelyillegal and clandestine activities, like it did to all revolutionaries ofhis time, Comrade Sverdlov also knew how to always marchshoulder to shoulder and hand in hand with the vanguardworkers under these conditions.

    To conclude. it is sufficient to recall that theserinciples of thebuilding of the revolutionary Party of theProletariat. of th
    Bolshevik Party, of the Party capable of taking power, did not fallout of the sky but were established in the midst of a great andhard struggle against the Mensheviks, the right opportunism ofthe time in Russia. Besides carrying out thele struggle for the
    Party's organizational principles Lenin had to do so wit
    a precise
    ackground: a right opportunist political line
    was from
    ere
    that he wisely concluded that problems of organization would notchange in 24 hours nor in 24 months. To finish, we recall that
    Lenin established that the parties advance in thee midst of struggle,almost always under enemy fire. In his own words
    We march together, arms linked, united, as a smallgroup alonga steep and difficult path. We are surrounded by enemies on allsides and must almost always march under fire. We have unitedourselves by virtue of a freely adopted decision, preciselystruggle against enemies and not fall or stumble into theneighboring

    beginning that we separated ourselves into another group and
    at we have chosen the path of struggle and not conciliation.

    Its construction and the struggle in its midst. In this
    article's initial citation we precisely quoted his thesis on thenecessity of the Party. It would be pointless to repeat it
    Going on to the problem of the partys construction we start outby noting that in Problems of War and Strategy, Chairman Maosets forth the construct based on the universal principle ofrevolutionary violence. Thus he teaches us
    The central task and the highest form of all revolution is the
    seizure oof power by means of the armed struggle. That is to say,
    he solution of the problem by means of war. This revolutionary
    Marxist-leninist principle has universal validity in China as wellas in other countries. (Mao, Vol 2, p. 219)
    Starting out from this Marxist-leninist principle anddifferentiating between the revolution in the capitalist countriesand in China. he established in the same work:
    In China the main form of struggle is war and the main form oforganization is the army. All the other forms, such as theorganizations and struggles of the popular masses are also veryimportant and absolutely indispensable, and by no means shouldthey be left aside. The goal of all these is to serve the war: before
    e outbreak of a warall the organizations and struggles have the
    duty of preparing for it,.After the outbreak of a war, all theorganizations and struggles coordinate themselves in a direct orindirect manner with the war. " (Mao, Vol 2, 221
    Develodinng the problem of the building of the Party, Chaairman
    Mao Tse-tung in Concerning the Appearance of The
    Communist Magazine sets forth and resolves fundamentalproblems. There he sets forth that, in the first place, the
    Communist Party of China carried out great and numerous
    173

==========第173页==========
    COLLECTED WORKS OF PCP-VOLUME 1(1968-1987
    struggles in which it forged its militants, its cadres aneorganizations, which obtained great victories and also sufferedserious defeats. And to understand the laws of the Partv'sdevelopment requires an analysis of its own history and extractingfrom it the solution to its problems of construction
    In the second place, in the judgment of his own Party in itsrelations with the bourgeoisie and its relations with the unitedfront and the armed struggle, he establishes the following great

    these complicated relations with the Chinese
    ourgeoisie the Chinese revolution and the Communist Party ofCIna
    as
    evelopeed. This is a historical particularity, a
    characteristic of the development of revolutions in the colonies orsemi colonies, a characteristic absent in history of revolution inany capitalist country. (Mao, Vol 2, P 286-7)
    This question is basic for we Communists and Peruvianrevolutionaries as our society is also semicolonial and semi-feudalfrom which it is derived that our revolution willl also bebourgeois-democratic iust like the first stage of the Chineserevolution, and In which, in consequence,The principal target ofthe revolution shall be imperialism and feudalism
    In the third
    ace,
    the Chinese revolution presents two
    particularities, in Chairman Maos own words

    In the fourth place, the preceding emphasizes that the buildingand development of the Communist Party of China cannot beunderstood on the margin of these two particularities which arebasic questions of the democratic revolutions political line. Thesame great leader teaches us
    The defeats and successes of the Party, its retreats or advancesthe reduction or growth of its ranks, its development andconsolidation cannot stop being linked by the Party,'s relationshiywith the bourgeoisie and with the armed struggle. When theolitical line firmly resolves the questions of establishing a unitedfront with the bourgeoisie or of the forced rupture of said unitedfront, the Party takes a step forward.In the same manner whenthe Party approaches the armed revolutionary struggle in a correcttorm it takes a step forward. The course of the Partyconstruction and its Bolshevikization has thus been tightly linkedto its political line, to its correct or erroneous resolution of theunited front and armed struggle questions
    In the fifth place, it unfastens the problem from a direction set inthe Chinese revolution. In the cited writing thee flown

    should make us think very seriously to see to what extent we areon the correct path
    The united front, the armed struggle and the construction of the
    Party thus constitute three fundamental questions of our Party inthe Chinese revolution. A correct understanding of these threequestions and of its mutual relations then signifies an accuratedirection for the entire Chinese revolution
    And finally, marking out the role of the Party he states
    Experience. shows us that the united front and the armed

    struggle are the two basic weapons by which to overcome theenemy. The united front is a front united to maintain the armedstruggle. And of the Party's organizations it is the heroiccombatants who wield these two weapons-the united front andthe armed struggle-to assault and destroy the enemys positions
    Such is the mutual relationship existing between these threetactors. (Mao, Vol 2, p. 295)
    It is here, to our understanding of the ideological and politicalbasis of the construction of the Party in a semicolonial andsemifeudal country which was established by Chairman Mao Tse
    Tung, that the importance of these questions cannot be obliqueslanted in any manner. Because as he himself teaches us: theideological and political basis must be correct, that not will decideeverything
    It is on this ideological and political base that Chairman Mao Tsetung rests his plan of the Party,'s organizational construction, ofits tactics and principlesof struggle. I his problem is set forth inpoint 6 of his article Audaciously Expand the Anti-japanese

    Chairman Mao has summarized the great historic experience ofthe CPC as to the two line struggle, with thee following words
    We must practice Marxism and not revisionism, unite and notdivide ourselves, be frank and honest and not foment intrigues ormachinations. "We subiect ourselves to this great lesson
    Nevertheless, we must never lose vigilance, as he himself taugh

    in 1964: We must be alert against those who foment intriguesand machinations. For example, Kao Kang, Yao Shu Shi, Peng Te

What are we going to do if they want to actlike that? Even now theere are peopledisSdoseed to plot. Thatconspirators exist is an obiective fact and not a question ofwhether we like it or not
    But what is the struggle within the Party for? In the end it is tomaintain unity and persist in Marxism, to reject schisms anerepudiate revisionism because, as he himself teaches us, unity israised over struggle and is relative while the other is absolute
    Thus, in consequence, the struggle is to maintain the unity
    Marxism, since unity is important. The internal unity of the
    Party and the unity between the Party and the people are twoweapons of incalculable value to overcome difficulties. All Partcomrades should appreciate theem

Speaking of the indigenous peasantshe said: The indigenous hope is absolutely revolutionary andreminded the PCP that in order to organize workers and peasantswith a class character. and to "stimulate first and afterwardsperformthe tasks of the bourgeois-democratic revolution, or toead the agrarian revolution

    Without revolutionary work among the peasant masses, this isolitically guided by Marxism-leninism, led by the Communist

    We emphasize the role of bureaucratic capitalism, which throughits development matures the final conditions for the triumph ofthe national-democratic revolution, Mao teaches us that thismonopolistic capital associated with State power, as well as subiectto and closely linked to imperialism and to the landlords forms amonopolistic, comprador and feudal state monopoly capital. InthS mannerItreachesthe peak of its development and prreparessufficient material conditions for the New Democratic
    Revolution, leaving the task of"confiscating the land of thefeudal class and giving it into the hands of the peasants"andseizing monopolists'capital". In our country, this bureaucraticcapitalism increasingly de
    glydeepens and employs the state monopoly
    capital as the lever of the economy, seeking to amass hugeamounts of cadital and to monopolize the vital arteries of theconomy. All of which leads inevitably to the same conclusionsthat were made by Mao Tse-tung on the topics of National
    Democratic Revolution and Peasant War. To analvze the Chinese
    lution, Mao Tse-tung established the extent at which thdeeply linked to one another peasant problem and the problem ofwar are absolute conditions of a bourgeois democratic revolution
    Thus, the bourgeois-democratic revolution in China has twomain characteristics: 1)the proletariat either establishes arevolutionaynational united front with the bourgeoisie, or breaksit when it feels obliged to, and 2)armed struggle is the main formof revolution. We do not consider here the relationship betweenthe party and the

    It is thus clear that the armed struggle that we have to carry out isan agrarian revolution, which shall be made by peasants under theleadership of the proletariat; which constitutes a constant, thenatural environment of the revolution. If the war has not vet beenbrought into motion, everything must serve to prepare it, and,once it starts, everything must serve to develop it
    The worker-peasant alliance. Mariategui has taught us
    The strength of the revolution always resided in the alliance ofagrarian land and labour, it is the worker and peasant masses
    In agreement with this, workers andPeasants willl form the basicmasses of the revolution, once they are mobilized and organizedte exploiters be overthrown and the revolution will triumph
    Based on the alliance of millions of workers and peasants, it willalso be possible to unite the urban petty bourgeoisie and, undercertain conditions, the national bourgeoisie.
    The peasantry is thele most numerous and most oppressed class,and over it weigh heavy chains oof the semi-feudal system, andtherefore it is a formidable force. In the words of our founder
    The Indian, so easily crippled by submission and cowardice, hasnot ceased to rebel against the semi-feudal regime that oppresses

In his greatwork, On New Democracy, he emphasized that with the First
    World War and with the October Revolution, history had entereda new era, of the new world revolution: the proletarian socialistworld revolution and that, in consequence, every revolutionundertaken by a colony or semi-colony against imperialism, thatis, against the bourgeoisie or international capitalism, will nomore belong to the old category of world democratic bourgeoisrevolution, but to the new category
    Thus, he conceived that the powerful revolutionary movement ofcolonies and semi-colonies was a part of the revolution that theinternational proletariat leads on a world level. He emphasized,after the Second World War, that the peoples of Latin Americaare not submissive slaves of the U.S. imperialists, that in thewhole of Asia a great national liberation movement had comeforth, and, calling the As

    All
    le reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionariesare terrifying, but in reality they are not so powerful. From along-term Doint of view it is not the reactionaries but the peoplewho are really powerful. In "Talk with Anna Louise Strong,where the above quotation is found, analyzing the contradictionsand the distribution of social forces. he also stated: The United
    States and the Soviet Union are separated by a vast zone whichincludes many capitalist, colonial and semi-colonial countries in
    Europe, Asia and Africa. Before the U. S. reactionaries havesubjugated these countries, an attack on the Soviet Union is outof the question. ' To these statements of 1946, the following of
    Chairperson Mao's analyses on the contradictions among theimperialists themselves and between the imperialists and theoppressed nations and contending forces must be added: " Abovethe contradiction that has to do with the scramble among the
    Imperialist countries and their dispute for the colonies stands out

    occurring there, two types of contradictions and three differentorces converge. These twotypebes of contradictions are
    the
    inter-imperialist contradictions, that is, the contradictions betweenthe United States and England and between the United States and
    France, and second, the ones that exist between the imperialist

    In this way, he denounces U.S. imperialism, calling us to combatit. But the revisionists usurped power in the Soviet Unionrestoring capitalism and converting it into a social-imperialistcountry, which, as such, extended its penetration, subversioncontrol and domination, contending with Yankee imperialism forworld domination
    Focussing on the referred to intermediate zone, Chairperson Maodeclaimed: The Soviet Union is at present under a bourgeoisdictatorship, a grand bourgeois dictatorship, a German fascist typedictatorshipa Hitlerian type dictatorship. And calling for thestruggle against the two superpowers, he put down the followingimportant theses. The United States is a paaper tiger. Youshouldn't believe in it. It can be pierced by one stroke. Therevisionist Soviet Union is also a paper tiger. "Soviet revisionismand U.S imperialism, entering into conspiracy themselves, haveperpetrated so much wickedness and infamy that therevolutionary peoples of the whole world will not let them gounpunished. The people of all the countries are rising up. A newhistorical period of struggle against U.S. imperialism and Sovietrevisionism has begun.

    when the people of a small country dare to rise up in struggle,venture to grasp weapons and hold in their hands the destiny oftheir own country, they will unfailingly be able to defeat theaggression of a big country. This is a law of history. Chairperson
    Mao Tsetung always gave a lot of attention to tactical principles
    With regard to this, his work"On policy is of the greatestimportance; there he set down the fundamentaPollcv: In

    ON THE STATE
    The Peruvian State is a landowning-bureaucratic State. It is adictatorship of the feudal landowners and
    le big bourgeoisie
    under the command of Yankee imperialism, a dictatorship which
    as developed Inthis century in the shape of representative
    democracy and within it, in crucial moments, under militaryregimes to defend or develop the ruling order of exploitation
    Starting in the decade of the 1920s, the Peruvian State was led bythe comprador bourgeoisie, and after 1968, by the bureaucraticbourgeoisie; both factions of the big bourgeoisie. The Peruvian
    State is a type of State most commonly found in semi-feudal andsemi-colonial societies, in which it exerts a joint dictatorship oftwo classes: feudal landowners and big b
    g bourgeoisies (comprador
    or bureaucratic, as the case may be),under the leadership of theatter, but within the domain of imperialism or, lately inroads ofsocial-imperialism. It is a dictatorship which, whatever its systemot government(representative democracy or corporativism)andte politics guiding it (demoliberal or fascist)exploits andpresses the peop.

    and the peasantr

    who are well aware ot It, as

    experienced it as part of their daily struggle
    However, violence is not only reactionary. There is alsorevolutionary violence, from the people, whicch mobilizing
    peasants under the leadership of the proletariat generates apeople s army led by
    by the Communist Party. It is the violence that
    rises in the countryside and develops a war of masses to destroythe old State of landowners and big bourgeoisies in order to buildthe new democracy. Violence is a universal law. It is thetransformation of the old world through
    gn guns, the glorious road
    of President Mao Tse-tung
    Violence is written at the bottom of our history. The conquerorsused it to submit these lands and subiect them to colonial rule
    Tupac Amaru unleashed violence
    efend
    e rights and
    demands (reinvindicaciones )which mobilized hundreds ofthousands of indigenous peasants. Violence of yesterday andtoday, is the usual means of the struggle the peasants have intheir hands in their unfinished struggle for the"land to the tiller
    Violence is part of our society's centuries of histolDry, mainly of thepeasantry, that continues to confront the landowning-bureaucratic
    State, especially against gamonalism which is the old States baseand sustenance
    But revolutionary violence in our history has reached a newdimension under the proletariat, resumed in Mariategui and his
    Party. In this way, since the last fifty years, in which the PCP wasfounded, the old bourgeois revolution became a revolution of anew democracy. It became an anti-imperialist and anti-feudalrevolution which only the proletariat through its Party is able to

    ON ELECTTIONS
    Marx pointed out: "Every so many years thee oppressed areauthorized to decide which members of the oppressor claass WIrepresent them and crush them in Parliament! And that is stillmore valid when it comes to elections to approve constitutionalcharters. That way, if the elections are the regular order ofrenewin
    the bourgeois dictatorship of capitalist societies
    (including the most democratic ones), one couldImaginenormal course of its political functioning for the preservation andevelopment of capitalism. In the landowning-bureaucratic States,
    like those of Latin America, in which they have accompl
    Shed
    their role of changing governments, and in the circumstanceswhen they have respected the norms of the demoliberal bourgeoissystem, elections have only been the tools at the service of the
    euda andowners anad big capitalists, whether it is a periodic
    renewal, as is being done lately in Colombia, or the end of amilitary government, as in Argentina for example
    The above is easily verifiable in the country. With importantinterruptions by the military governments during the periodic

    other. to the contradictions between feudal landowners andetween
    thee comprador bourgeoisie, aned the bureaucratic
    bourgeoisie, it is important to note that the military regimesthemselves have been instrumental in implementing elections, beit to normalize their own situation, end their rule, or to guaranteethem. Elections in Peru have undoubtedly served toPreserve or
    the old Peruvian State, the formal republic, the
    dictatorship of feudal landowners and the big bourgeoisie
    Therefore, elections have been (and it could not have been another way within the context of the ruling social order)tools inthe hands of the comprador bourgeoisie first, and then a tool ofthe bureaucratic bourgeoisie. This has been the most importantaspect of the electoral processes of the Peruvian State in thicentury and it's what has determined the class character ofelections in the country. These ftundamental questions are
    Summarized as tows
    The Peruvian State is landowning and bureaucratic. It is adictatorship of feudal landowners and big bourgeois, under thecontrol of Yankee imperialism. Against this, the people's strugglemust destroy the old existing order in order to build a State of
    new democracy
    The Peruvian State, like every State, sustains, defends andevelops itself using violence; it faces what the people need, whichis revolutionary violence following the road surrounding the citiesfrom the countryside
    Elections are means of domination by landowners and bbourgeois capitalists. They are not tools of transformation for thepeople nor a means to overthrow the power of those who areruling. Therefore, the correct orientation for us is to use electionsten it comes only for purposes of agitation and propaganda

    This problem requires the analysis of two issues: The economicsituation and crisis in the country, and the third restructuring ofthe Peruvian State
    THE ECONOMIC SITUATION AND CRISIS
    After the Second World War, the development of bureaucraticcapitalism was increased. This type of capitalism can be traced tothe end of the last century. The expansion of bureaucraticcapitalism is more considerable in the 1960,s, especially after
    October of 1968, with the current regime which is based on the
    Prodem o
    the peasantry. To this end, it carried out the more
    P
    extensive and profound evolution of feudal landowning property.
    As a result, there is a greater concentration of the property landte preservation of servile forms of exploitation, bureaucraticmanagement systems and direct control by the State overterritorial rents. Thus, the State lays the roots for bureaucraticcapitalism in the countryside
    In synthesis, the expansion of bureaucratic capitalism aims at theprocess of industrialization and generates, an industry moredependent on imperialism (mainly Yankee), as well as greaterparticipation by the State, especial
    those industries which are
    considered basic and extractive. Thus. the State becomes themotor that sustains the economic process, and plays a principalrole in banking, finance, including trade
    In this manner, the expansion of bureaucratic capitalism is thecontinuation of the capitalist process already pointed out by
    Mariategui: a capitalism subject to the domination of Yankeeimperialism, and linked to feudalism. It is this process andexpansion(profundizacion )that have generated the current crisis
    Peruvian society is going through, which is aggravated by the

    The crisis, in essence, is the result of the expansion of thecapitalist development in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country

    D =large and veryarge properties(latifundio
    If we add the agrarian debt of tens of thousands of soles, 68% ofwhich total is payable to the landowners, 24% of which isayment for credits due to the bankers, and 8% of which isbureaucratic expense; and if we bear in mind that the State hasextracted 6.473 billion soles for real estate taxes from theproduction of agrarian cooperatives in the five-year period 19711975, of which 3,639 billion, more than 50% was taken in 1975can anyone then speak of the old semi-feudal system as havin

    backbone of the "oligarchy? " Isn't it clear who benefits and who isprotected by the agrarian law? But let's see other data
    On these tables. recession and inflation are seen verryclear
    ev
    also show the diminished production and rise in prices that whilthe Peruvian economy, as well as the serious situation of the Statebudget. But let's point out, that whilee wages were multipletour from 1968 to 1976, profits for enterprises or businesses were

    multiplied by seven in the samePeriod. And if we add theevolution of wages and salaries, based on the indices of actualremuneration for metropolitan Lima(since there are no other)wages were 100 soles in 1968, by December of 1977, had beenreduced to 72.23 soles, and it is foreseen that by Deecenter1978 they will be reduced to 52.29 soles, whereas the salaries thatwas 100 soles in 1968, in December of 1977 was reduced to 86.95and it is predicted that by December of 1978 they will be reducedto 60.70 soles. These figures are enough to see the situation inwhich the economic production develops, who benefits from itand whom it hits. and the above does not take into considerationthe bankruptcies, factory clClosings, layoffs, etc. s which added ontothe above show the serious crisis and the ongoing process ofgreater concentration of capital forthe benefit of the landownersthe big capitalists and imperialism
    To complete this trend, lets see the problem of the foreign debtand the real value of the sol, which shows clearly, the domain ofimperialism and the dispute between the superpowers. Rememberthat in September of 1975 exchange was established at 45 soles toa dollar, in June of 1976 it went down to 65, then came the
    munidevalluationsthat ended in 80 soles to a dollar by September
    of 1977; and from October of that year came on floating, whichraised the exchange to 130, in December, and now, to speculationpaying 180 soles per dollar in money order certificates, althoughthe official exchange value did not vary; a situation intimatellinked to the International Monetary Fund controlled by the
    United States. According to official figures, in 1968, the country'soreign debt was 737 million dollars, but by 1977 it was 4.17billion dollars, a sum that forced the use of up to 41% of exportsto cancel off interest payments of the debt in 1977. The foreigndebt is one of the hottest problems today and from this we cansee how the superpowers contend in our country, as can also beseen by the Yankee concern that their loans are not used to Da228

    ABOUT THE THIRD RESTRUCTURING OF THE PERUVANSTATE
    The bureaucratic bourgeoisie was developed during the Second

    Under what conditions did this promotion take place? It takesplace amidstthe crisis of the so-called representative democrac
    The Peruvian State was organized as a formal bourgeoisdemocracy, systematically, with the Constitution of 1920, under

    However, the 1929-1934 crisis and the development of the classstruggle, mainly by the proletariat, with the founding of the
    Communist Party, generated a period of upheaval in ourcontemporary history. Also, during this period the elections of1931 took place, which drafted the current Constitution still forceat least in words.)
    The constitution of 1933 has the characteristics that Karl Marxmasterfully pointed out
    while it recognizes the demo-bourgeois type rights and
    erties, each article sanctioning them contains its owncontradiction, that is, the same time that rights and freedoms arestipulated, they are lawfully restricted. The following samplessuffice and it's precisely one of the examples given by Marx, Art62 reads: "All persons have the right to assemble peacefullyandwithout weapons, without compromising the public order. Thelaw will regulate the exercise of the right to assemble
    It shows the contradiction between the Executive Power andthe Legislative Power, and while in its words, the latter attempts

As these mattersare foreseen,they will be found again in the new Constitutionand its debates. but on the base of the contradiction betweenrepresentative democracy and corporativism
    After 1945, all these constitutional contradictions sharpened withthee struggle between the comprador bourgeoisie and thebureaucratic bourgeoisie and more by the increasing developmentof the force of the people and of the working class. During thegovernment of Bustamante. the contradiction PariamentgExecutive sharpened, and the President himself had to propose
    the need for a new Constitution. The problem surfaced againduring the Belaunde government and there were many d

    about a referendum and reform of the Constitution. which in1965 took Action Popular to draft and introduced a bill about thefunctional Senate, a corporativist modality established by article89 of the Constitution, but never implemented up to this day,
    Since eventhe Action Populars bill was rejected by the APRA

    Under these circumstances the armed forces took over theleadership of the State in function, mainly the interests of thebureaucratic bourgeoisie, with two tasks to fulfill: the first one, tocarry forward the expansion of bureaucratic capitalism andsecond, to reorganize Peruvian society. That is how the currentregime began, guided by a fascist political conception, developingte corporativization of the Peruvian Society, which is a processthat is taking place through the following three phases
    1. Bases and development of the corporativization, in which allpast practices are questioned, labeled as the old
    re
    revolutionary order, the bases of organization are set and the socalled"ideological bases "are established. This lasted all the way to1975.
    2. General corporative readjustment, and evaluation of itssuccesses and problems so as to consolidate
    lidate positions and advance
    toward the Corporative State, Presented as a"social democracwith fulllparticlpation.That began with the replacement of

    In the first stage of corporativization, the bureaucratic bourgeoisiemanaged to isolate the proletariat, and even to partially tie itdown, presenting itself as a progressive force and as arevolutionary"with the support of opportunism, mainly thesocial-corporativist revisionism of Unidad
    In the second stage, the general readjustment of corporativismthe influence of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie in State affairs beganto decrease, its mask fell and it shed its disguises making it moredifficult for opportunism to tie down the proletariat to the tail ofits enemy.

    elections are the real beginning of the third restructuring of the
    Peruvian State by the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and the ones whowill struggle most to carry the corporativization forward as muchthey are able to, aiming at establishing themselves as the leadingclass of the exploiters. The ongoing State restructuring is aconsequence of the expansion of bureaucratic capitalism and thecorporativization of Peruvian society and the elections are in factits beginnings. Theyare a preamble to institutionalize thestructural transformations "whose consequences for the people arein sight. Well then, the Constituent Assembly elections help firstand foremost the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. That is our mainconcern. This is the starting point in taking a position withregards to the ongoing electoral process; and in doing it that way,we, and those who follow Marxism-leninism-mao Tse-tung
    Thought, those who really follow the road of Mariategui and whoare at the service of the proletariat and the people, cannot fail totake into account this basic question and must judge it trom the

    ON THE CONVERGENCE F CLASSES: EACTIONS ANDPARTIES N THE REA CTONARY CAMP
    For years, the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and more specifically thearmed forces, in its name, have wanted to exercise leadership othe State and do away with the comprador bourgeoisie and thefeudal landowners, outside the margin ordered by the
    Constitution and conform themselves to their own statutesconcentrating all State powers, postponing the politicalorganizations and even casting aside civilians for the benefit notjust of the military in active service, but even the retired military
    This contradiction does not mean that it has not represented andkept in mind the interests of its allies, the comprador bourgeoisie236

    State Power took the bureaucratic bourgeoisie(during thee crisis othe representative democracy )to appeal to the armed foorces assustenance of power itself, which was the institution in a positionof Dower to advance its interests
    But ten years have elapsed and today their main purpose is therestructuring of the State, which will generate the convergence ofthe exploiting classes, its factions and its parties. Is this anythingstrange? No, as Marx demonstrated. Thus, the restructuring of the
    State will cause a convergence of the two factions of the bbourgeoisiethe comprador and the bureaucratic factions, and
    especialy of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie with the feudal
    landowners. However, this convergence does not exclude their
    Discrepanciesbut, the need of restructuringthe State and the
    situation of crisis in which this develops, enlivens thoseendeavors. both for thee andowners an
    or
    e comprador
    bourgeoisie, to recover positions and to defend their interests. Inthat way, the need to restructure the State benefits the exploitingclasses, and what takes them to a convergence, because they mustrestructure the State order which enables them to preserve anddevelop their exploitation and rule and provides them with aconstitutional order allowing a normal and periodic process ofrenewal of the powers of the State. But at the same time, theendeavors to have the interests of their class or faction prevail,and above all their contention for the leadership of the Stateenlivens their divergences. The historical tendency of theexploiters under the rule of imperialism, mainly Yankee, is thedevelopment of the process of corporatization, which at thistime, is the convergence in order to restructure the State. Theirproposals on the social pact is a good example,but thisconvergence or collusion of interests develops amidst sharpcontradictions which become more intense as the peoplesstruggle develops

    revisionism which has as its voice "Unidad. " In thegeneraelections of 1936, 1939, 1945 and 1963, opportunism tied downthe people and the working class to the band wagon of the bbourgeoisie, of the comprador bourgeoisie before World War II
    and of the bureaucratic one afterwards. The essence of this
    electoral line and of parliamentary cretinism is synthesized in thefollowing proposals which sustained the 1945 elections: the
    workers as a whole have
    te historical task of strugglin
    or an
    lliance with the bourgeoisie we no longer launch candidateswith the aim of agitation and propaganda. Now we launch tomake representatives out of them, "proposals which were
    accompanied
    by these statements: we will only resort to the

    Ppeaceful solution is not possible...But before we go on striking
    must exhaust the lawful and peaceful me

    Politics, which is thele class struggle for power, has entered Into ourcountry in a moment of great importance. Counterrevolution, theureaucratic roaad, led by the bureaucratic bourgeoisie as a faction
    of the big bourgeoisie, is developing the third restructuring of the
    State in this century. Ever since it approved the new Constitution,it aims at celebrating general elections in May of 1980. On theother hand. the revolution, the democratic road. whose axis is theproletariat, strengthens the growing popular protest and orientsitself to its development in function of initiating thee armed
    struggle
    The central point on the current political question is the existenceor nonexistence of a revolutionary situation. The definition of thisproblem is of vital transcendence for the people and is the objectof persistently hard and fundamental debate. To us in the light of
    Marxism,
    our country is going through a developing
    revolutionary situation, and consequently, the strategy and tacticsto follow must depart from this reality. Furthermore, all Peruvianpolitics at the present time, the struggle between revolution andcounterrevolution, cannot be treated outside the frame of

    particularly facing future elections. These are thee errors whoseprincipal consequence is to focus in the plan of reaction, and notin the development of the revolution
    THE NATIONALDEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION IN THECOUNTRY
    When he founded the Communist Party, Mariategui establishedthat in Peru, the revolution would have two stages: democraticand socialist; the first one is the prerequisite and condition for thesecond, and can only be led by the proletariat through its Partthe Communist Party. It is in the first stage of the revolution that
    President Mao Tse-tung defined as the new democratic revolutionthat is, anti-imperialist and anti-feudal, since it has to scrub awathe feudalism that subsists and break off the imperialist domain
    As history has proven to society, this can only be accomplished bythe armed struggle,
    dle, that is the Peoples War, following the path of
    surrounding the cities from the countryside. This is a fundamentaltruth from which all proletarian politics must be based
    e road
    of the armed struggle starts from the countryside to the cities, issupported mainly by the peasantry, who rise up in arms, underthe leadership of the Communist Party, generates the peoplesarmed forces as the principal form of organization. It is the formin which revolutionary violence is synthesized in semi-feudal andsemi-colonial countries. This is a revolutionary violence which isprecisely the veryessence oof Marxism. So being a Marxistapplying in theory and in practice the conception oftheproletariat, in countries like ours, demands to subordinateourselves to the armed struggle and, therefore, center the activityin starting it, if it has not started, and developing it if it hasalready started. This matter is clear and simple andthere is noway to twist it if we sustain ourselves in Marxism-leninism-mao

    COLLECTED WORKS OF PCP-VOLUME 1(1968-1987
    proletariat, the people and the revolution in deeds, and not merely
    In emptyworas
    All the above are elemental truths of the international experience
    and were thorouIghly debated in our country in the decade of the
    1960s, a time when Peruvian Communists, reaffirmed and upheldthe great theses of Mariategui and adhered themselves to the great
    Len pment which Mao Tse-tung Thought meant for Marxism-Leninism, and concluded that in the country the revolution isdemocratic and can only be fulfilled by armed struggle and not byelections, following the road from the countryside to the ci
    and
    taking as its main force the peasantry, especially the poorpeasantry. Thhis is a great experience of our people, of our classand of Communism in Peru. It is an experience which nobodwho upholds Marxism can forget to take into account the currentconditions of development
    We the Communists in the country, and all the revolutionariesmust ask ourselves a simple question: why is it that the workingclass has not vet conquered Power in our country? The answer isconcise: It is because up to now, an armed struggle has not beendeveloped nor have we initiated it nor applied the
    rincidles o
    Marxism-leninism-mao Tse-tung Thought. There is in Peru, along electoral experience and man8
    ly times the people have been
    called, and the revolutionaries have been taken to participate inelections. As a result, there have not been any fundamental
    h
    enefits for the class or for the people and muc
    ess, of course,
    conducive to the conquest of Power. The class and the peoplehave been called to participate on the supposition thattranscendental decisions and consequences were at play or stake
    That way, the masses of thee people put their hopes and becameocused on the elections as the main task which disoriented themand took them away from their own road. What have the classand the people gotten out of such electoral activities? Other than254

    a few spots in the chamber of deputies or the senate, whichultimately only benefit their supposed representatives, have onlhelped to sow parliamentary cretinism, fuel up opportunism and
    reaPdisillusionments. Well then, in our country, there is a ve
    dark electoral traiectory and a bitter experience we cannot forget
    We must remember that in every electoral process in the countropportunism goes wild sowing illusions, dreaming about takingup positions in government, invoking a feigned defense of themasses, offering great democratic advances and generatinguncontrolled greed and appetite. All these politicians aim at ridingon the peoples struggle in function of their own dark purposes
    These are concrete lessons of our country and they show that theactors can change or survive, but electoral opportunism remains,
    It of it for the people, except taking them off
    e correct path
    We also have had many popular struggles and even insurrectionalactions in the cities of Peru. not to even mention the so-calledrevolutions, "which have merely been military pronouncementsor coups d'etat that at one point or another even involved sectionsof the people. However, none of these actions, some of them very
    eroic actions. have resulted inPower for
    e class or for
    e
    people, but were very bloodily crushed by the Army, or theiroutcome has only served and helped one faction or another of theexploiting classes. This shows that the road to take power isneither the uprising nor the insurrection in the cities. That isanother fundamental experience of our revolutionary struggle,which must vaccinate us against insurrectional roads ostensiblcentered in
    e working class, asthete principal force of
    e
    revolution in the countr
    Similarly, in the countryside many peasants'struggles have beencarried out, but none of them were developed as an armed

    struggle. They have been unable to free the peasant
    to give
    them land, and much less have they generated a new Power, anew State for the class and for the people. Linked to the largepeasants mobilization of the mid 1960s, we have the guerrillastruggle of MIR and the ELN, but not following the conception ofthe proletariat on the People' s War, nor being properly linked tothe peasantry, they were crushed. However, these guerrilla actionsleft great experiences for our people.
    What do all of these facts show? They simply show that in morethan 50 years of the Communist Party and revolution of the newdemocracy up to now, the working class has not taken Poower andtherefore, the people of Peru have been unable to free theemselvesof imperialist domination or to sweep away feudalism. Howeverwe have participated in many electoral processes. The masses haverebelled in the cities, the peasants have battled and spilled theirood heroically, and we even have had guerrillas, although not a
    Peoples War. Despite all of this, the proletariat and the peoplelave not been able to conquer Power. Thus, up to the presenttime, the democratic revolution, the revolution of new democracthe national-democratic revolution has not been developed
    Therefore, we have not followed the road of encircling the 8s
    through armed struggle according to the principles of People
    War sustained in Marxism-leninism-mao Tse-tung Tho
    citles
    from the countryside and, consequently, we have not createdrevolutionary support bases in the country nor have we builtrevolutionary Power sustained by the people's armed forces. Thisis the reason why we have not destroyed the old social order andthe working class, and the people have not conquered Power
    What follows from all that? Concretely, up to now, the nationaldemocratic revolution has not begun to be developed in itshighest form and, therefore, the principal task of the revolution in
    Peru is to initiate the armed struggle; that is the central task of256

    the democratic revolution. All must be done for this purpose andthat is, consequently, the central activity toward which allcommunists and revolutionaries must orient themselves if theytruly want to be at the service of the proletariat, the people andthe revolution. In that way, the pending task of the democraticrevolution in our country is to begin the armed struggle
    In general terms, many revolutionaries and some organizations inthe midst of the people are in agreement with the above, but
    calim that while that is the strategy to follow, current conditions
    o notallow us to focus on initiating the
    8
    le armed struggle
    According to them, there is no revolutionary situation, andtherefore, we must center ourselves on activities lilke moobilizingthe masses even on elections, precisely, they say, to generate a
    revolutionaury situation. Thus, the debate on whether or not arevolutionary situation exists in the country, has become afundamental problem of our politics, which must beJuaged veseriously in the light of Marxism and the analysis of our ownreality. Lets address this issue taking as a basis the thesis of Leninand Mao Tse-tun
    LENIN AND THE REVOLUTIONARY SITUATON
    Lenin set forth fundamental theses about the revolutionarsituation. Analyzing the great strike movements
    e workin
    Class and
    the peoples struggle in ththe second decade of this
    century in the old tsarist Russia, he established that their rootsand their cause, were the existence of a revolutionary situation. Toillustrate this matter he wrote the following
    oppression of the vast majority of the population, not just E, sRussia lives in a revolutionary situation because of the crush
    roletariat. but nine tenths of the smalll
    P
    Producers, mainly the

    sharpened oppression, the hunger, the misery, the denial of theirrights and the humiliation inflicted upon the people, is in blatantdisagreement with the state of productive forces in Russia, withthe degree of conscience and the level of the reivindication of themasses
    Can we say that such conditions do not exist today in ourcountry, and for many years? It is evident that these conditionsare present in Peruvian society and, furthermore, such conditionslave entered these past

    Do we need to prove that the hunger, the misery, the denial of
    etr rghts and the humiliation is inflicted upon the
    Peru? All that is so evident that nobody can deny it andmoreover, we don't need to look at the distant past, and all thathas been worsening since 1968, since the present regime took over
    Power. It has been getting worse by the daup to the crisis we
    ly up
    suffer today, since 1975. Can anyone deny the harsh realityourcountry suffers? Nobody. No one who is based on the mostelementary objective analysis of our reality can deny it. Preciselythe existence of these conditions of oppression and exploitationare themselves the base of the revolutionary situation. For thisituation to emerge clearly, we also need another condition, as
    Lenin himself says:
    Oppression, however great, not always results in a revolutionarysituation in a country. For the revolution to explode, it is notsufficient that the ones below do not want togo on Ivin
    as
    before. It is also necessary that those above are not able to go onmanaging, and ruling as they did up to that time
    That is how Lenin defined what a revolutionary situation is, and258

==========第258页==========
    DEVELOP THE GROWING PEOPLES PROTEST
    what the obiective conditions is. He synthesized them in two
    Cases
    that those below don't want to go on living as before and
    hose above are unable to go on managing and ruling as they
    Id up to now
    Those are the two conditions that generate mobilization of themasses, their struggles, and the strike movement of theproletariat, among others. It is not, then, the mobilization of themasses that generates the revolutionary situation, but theopposite; the revolutionary situation, the objective condition ofthe revolution is what cause the mobilization. This is their effect
    In addition, it is very important to note that Lenin considers thatthe revolutionary situation generates a political crisis at the verybase of the State: in his own words, he states
    Russia is in the middle of a political crisis on a national scaleand it is precisely a crisis which aftects the bases of the statestructure, and in no way some minor part of it. It affects theoundations of the building and not this or that accessory, this orthat foor
    This is fundamental, and the revolutionary situation affects thevery bases, the foundations of the State and therefore"a reformistexit of the situation is not possible. Patches or sutures areinadequate, and the only possible solution is a revolutionary exit
    Lenin himself, masterfully summarized the revolutionalsituation. as follows

    All that seems to have been written for our country today! We
    ight the problem of those above; obviously in Peru, theoseabove cannot continue to govern and administer things as thedid up to now. The proof of this is the third restructuring of the
    State that is being stipulated in the new Constitution. Evidently, ithas to do with the basis of the state, its foundations. and affectsthe entire state order
    The transcribed quotation of Lenin clearly summarizes a situationvery much like that in our country today, a result of the existentobiective conditions and revolutionary situation in our countr
    However, in Peru there is a serious confusion about this problem
    Some erroneously consider that the mobilization of the masses isthe cause for the existence of the revolutionary situation. Thiidea obviously contradicts the exceedingly clear theeses formulatedby Lenin, and it has a purpose: to prioritize the reformist strugglemovimiento reinvindicativo)of the masses in order to postponehe revolution, the seizure of Power and, ultimately, to blockrevolutionary violence in order to go after thee electoral processes,and propagate parliamentary cretinism. Others in the countryormulate that the revolutionary situation derives and develops bycomplementing the objective conditions with the subjectiveconditions, which indicates another serious error. Subjectiveconditions, to Lenin, imply the class and the instruments to carrforward the revolution, as he stated in the followin
    260

==========第260页==========
    DEVELOP THE GROWING PEOPLES PROTEST
    Neither the oppression of those below nor the crisis of thoseabove, is enough to produce the revolution the only thing theesewill achieve is the putrefaction of the country, if the country inuestion lacks a revolutionary class capable of transforming th9passive state of oppression into an active state of wrath and
    Insurrection
    Therefore, a revolutionary situation or objective conditions of therevolution, are not the same as the subjective conditions. Thelatter are the class and the instruments capable of converting8therevolutionary situation into revolutionary violence, which in ourcountry means an armed struggle, the united front, a Party tomanage both, a proletariat capable of leading and fulfilling its roleas the leading class, and a peasantry capable of rising up in arms
    MAO TSE-TUNG AND THE OBIECTIVE SITUATION INTHE BACKWARD COUNTRIES
    President Mao Tse-tung uses the term objective situation toanalyze the revolutionary situation or the objective conditions ofthe revolution and their development in backward countries, thatis. semi-feudal and semi-colonial. He starts off from the need topenetrate to the essence of things and not stay with simpleappearances. To him, the main thing is to consider the semi
    euda
    ase and imperialist oppression of the backward countries
    Under these conditions. the revolution is democratic. that is. antifeudal and anti-imperialist, whose development demands thearmed struggle from the countryside to the city throughrevolutionary support bases as the New State, which begins toemerge and simultaneously, the old bureaucratic landowningreactionary State is being destroyed. This is fundamental inunderstanding the specific conditions that the revolutionarsituation has in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, and thedevelopment of these societies

    President Mao Tse-tung establishes the conditions that conform tothe obiective situation and also the contradictions that exist, andfrom which the road of the revolution derives, which in essence isthe armed struggle, and the inevitable triumph of the revolution
    As stated in point four of his work, " A Single Spark Can Set the

    contradictions

    Soviet social-imperialism. These contradictions have an impact onour country as contradictions in the midst of thee exploiters,

The procedure that is bein8ollowed under the current regime and the situation todaly provesthis. In addition, the masses ofPeople are the ones, who throuindirect taxation, support the state expenditures more and more; asituation which is getting worse and will continue to worsen
    Contradiction between imperialism and national industry. Inthe country this contradiction is evident: the national industry isincreasingly subject to imperialist domination and access tomarkets is more restricted every day. On the other hand, theaggression by foreign imports (e.g, commodities )handled byimperialism, restricts the development of the national industry,
    an
    d the financial impositions of imperialism, sinks it into aneconomic recession, which is worsened by the worldwide crisis262

In this way, the situation of the peasantry hasworsened by the evolution of feudalism resulting from theagrarian law, and the penetration of bureaucratic capitalism intothe countryside

    suffices to recall the situation of bankruptcy confronted by thesmall industrial producers and small merchants, as well as smallminers. We must highlight the serious situation faced by theambulatory merchants who are affected by a brutal repressionand much repression falls upon them. But the crises hit the

    Throughout the country the development and reinforcement ofte reactionary armed and police force is evident, both in size ofcontingents and in weaponry. This is shown by the creation ofnew repressive bodies of the state and the widening of theirfunctions, and the greater control they exert over society

    contradictions that are developing, and in no way can they beresolved by a reactionary government. Furthermore, we all knowthat these contradictions are not being resolved, but continue tosharpen, so the obiective situation in our country is and will beeach time more propitious to the development of revolution, andto the development ofa superior form, the armed struggle.
    Consequently, the most important matter that concerns all of usis to start the armed struggle. This is an unavoidable perspectivethat our country has. What other road can we follow in Peru?
    What other hopes can our popular masses and the proletariathave? President Mao Tse-tung stated the followingconcluded his analysis
    By understanding all these contradictions, we will realize thedesperate situation, the chaotic state faced by China today and we

    President Mao Tse-tung established a brilliant distinction betweena
    eveloping revolutionary situation and a stationary,
    revolutionary situation, as can be seen in Point three of chapter IIf his work, Why Red Power Can Exist in China? He statedthat in a semi feudal and semicolonial country such as ours, thereis always a revolutionary situation, or objective situation as hecalls it, for the development of an armed struggle, however this

    occurs in two forms:
    a stationary revolutionary situation anda revolutionary situation in development
    analvzinng his theses we are able to say that a stationary
    revolutionary situation can be transformed into a developingrevolutionary situation, by the action of the subiective conditionson the objective condition; that is very important to keep in mind
    In addition, we must be able to differentiate between unevendevelopment and revolutionary situation and take into accountthat the latter can occur in a region, and then the revolution maspread to the entire country, or it can even begin by a generalretreat of the revolution, as was shown by the autumn harvestuprising of August 1927 in China

    Thus, if we base ourselves on Marxism-leninism-mao Tse-tung
    Thought, and analyze the concrete reality of the Peruvianrevolution, we have to conclude that we live in a developingrevolutionary situation and, consequently, all strategy, tactics andpolitical actions must be based on that fact, if not, we would begrossly mistaken. In synthesis, the class struggle, the antagoniccontention between revolution and counterrevolution, can only beseen accurate

On the otherhand, the development of the democratic road, the classes thatmake up the people, and whose axis is the proletariat.

    THE REACTIONARY PLAN RESTRUCTURING ANDGENERAL ELECTIONS
    Since July 1977, the bureaucratic road continues the thirdrestructuring of the Peruvian State in this century. It celebratedelections for the Constituent Assembly which in a year approveda new Constitution and recently convoked for a general electionto be held in May 1980. What does it mean? Has the State beenfortified? Has it overcome the crisis afflicting it for such a longtime? Let's analyze this
    Ever since the end of World War II, the ascending b
    g
    ureaucratic
    bourgeoisie aimed at restructuring the State and, from thebeginning of the present regime aimed toPromulgate a new
    Constitution. That was the purpose of its corporative and fascistolicies. It also aimed at developing organizations which couldprovide a corporative base to the State, including the organizationof a political party. The failed Political Organization of the
    Peruvian Revolution( OPRP), which had already publicized its so
    called ideological Dases, Is an examdleHowever by mandate o
    Yankee imperialism and the profound crisis of the countrySince1975, the international situation tended toward representativedemocracy "in Latin America, and the plans of thee bureaucraticbourgeoisie were disrupted. Thus, the new Constitution does notfully express the corporative plans expected by the bureaucraticbourgeoisie neither does it satisfies completely the needs of the socalled"representative democracy. "Consequently, the Constitutionborn under the aegis of bayonets of the armed forces, and productof a mediocre Constituent Assembly satisfies neither Tyrians nor
    Trojans in the reactionary camp, much less can it be a Charterable to satisfy the people, and as soon as it goes into effect, thebattles will begin to amend it. As was the case of the Constitutionof 1920, the perspective of the new Constitution is one of
    268

    DEVELOP THE GROWING PEOPLES PROTEST
    contention or collision between the two factions of the bbourgeoisie of Peru: the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and thecomprador bourgeoisie. The perspective is to amend it, within thehistorical process of the bureaucratic road, the logic of thereaction will be a new restructuring for a more thorough
    orativization of the Peruvian State. in function of theleadership and exercise of Power by the bureaucratic bourgeoisie
    On the other hand, for the people and the proletariat the problemwill be to sweep away this new Constitution, and of any otherkind that expresses the old existing order, and to elaborate onewhich truly meets their class interests. This will only be achieved
    Dy forging a State of New Democracy by the victorious armeorces of the people
    This is the situation and the perspective of the third
    Ira restructuring,
    and for this reason the following question arises: Is the Peruvian
    State a strong one? In"A Single Spark Can Set the Entire Prairieon Fire"President Mao wrote
    Although the
    g
    le subiective forces of the Chinese revolution are
    weak at the present time, the whole organization(the Power, thearmed forces, the parties, etc. ) of the reactionary ruling classes, anorganization based on the backward and fragile socia aneconomic structure of China
    is also weak. And even though
    the subjective forces of revolution in China are now weak, nodoubt the revolution advances to its submit quicker than in
    Western Europe. That is because here the forces of thecounterrevolution are relatively weak as well
    This great truth formulated in 1930, and was historically provenin China and in other backward countries, and we must keep thisin mind without forgetting our specific conditions. And, why doeshis fragility of the State happen? If we analyze the theses of
    269

    COLLECTED WORKS OF PCP-VOLUME 1(1968-1987
    President Mao on the State in the backward countries. we willunderstand why. In his work On the New Democractreating the systems of the various States, he states
    " The first kind is the State of the Old Democracy. Today, after the
    Second World War began, no traces of democracy remain inmany capitalist countries. They have been transformed or are inte process of being transformed in States in whicl

    And later on: Here we are speaking about the ' system of the
    State. Decades of disputes, which began in the last vears of the
    Ching dynasty, have not been able to clarify this matter
    reality, the problem simply refers to the place occupied by the
    various social classes within the State. The bourgeoisie alwaysdes the place occupied by the classes, and exercises itsdictatorship of one class under the label ofnational. This coverup does not benefit the revolutionary people at all,
    reason, this matter must be explained clearly to them.*nd for this
    ASo, he says
    With respect to the question of the 'system of
    government, it is the shape in which Power is organized, theshape in which a given social class impresses upon
    on the organs o
    Power it establishes so as to fight off its enemies and protect itself.
    Without adequate organs of Power representing them, there is no
    State
    President Mao Tse-tung developed the Marxist theory on the
    State. He resolved the problem of the State in the backward, semifeudal and semi-colonial countries. He started off by pointing outthat it is the ioint dictatorship of two classes, of bourgeois and oflandowners. He differentiated the system of State from the270

    system of government, the former expressing the kind ofdictatorship, which in our case is a dictatorship of thebourgeoisie and the feudal landowners. He highlighted that thesystem of State"indicates thePosition of the various classesithin the structure of the State. which in our case means theplacing of the six classes in our society: a big bourgeoisie with itsbureaucratic factions. the feudal landowners. the nationabourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie, the peasantr
    and
    proletariat.
    The "system of government, as Marx clearly states, is"the shapein which power is organized to exercise the dictatorship, anorganization which in our case has the form of a republicsustained by the so-called representative democracy This is theorganizational form upon which it sought to incorporatecorporative forms, but it had not succeeded fully by the new
    Constitution. It simply followed the process of development of
    State, has sanctioned the strengthening of the Executive Powersetting downthe bases for corporativization and establishing amore direct participation by the armed forces in the structure ofthe State and in the exercise of Power. It also, expanded thactions of the repressive forces through the

    If we keep in mind these substantive theses by President Mao Tsetungand at the same time a
    what was said about
    revolutionary situation and fracture of the State, then we
    understand clear
    that as a whole, and in perspective, the
    Peruvian State and its organizations are weak due to the economic
    and Soc1a
    ial backwardness sustaining them. This is a base upon
    which we have six classes, of which four suffer from oppressionand exploitation, mainly the two fundamental classes; theproletariat and the peasantry. Theerefore, we

    State in general, and especially that of the system of governmentitself. It is developing the contradictions between thee casseswhich exercise dictatorship and the various factions througlwhich the imperialists pretend to maintain their imperialist
    supremacy or undermine each other.
    Besides the fragility of the Peruvian State, in terms of state systemand government, which is essential and incurable due to itscondition as a semifeudal and semicolonial country(conditionthat will develop further), we must add the contradictions anddifficulties derived from the third restructuring of the State and itsongoing implementation, including the general elections. Thegeneral elections will be conducted after 17 years and

    a civilian government must emerge to substitute the armed forcesin the exercise of Power after 12 vears. This fragility is stressed bthe insurmountable circumstances that continue to developamidst the worst crisis Peru has seen in this century. This is asituation in which a new Constitution must be appliedimplemented and even modified in order to confront a popularmovement in development. Furthermore, the increasing protestswill increase the demands for better ivingconditions. It willgenerate an overflowof the masses to meet its most basic

    Lets highlight that while compensation to workers went UD from1960 to 1968, it went down from 1968 to 1977. We also must
    Point out that there is a constant reduction in the percentagecorresponding to farmers, which goes parallel to the increase inthe return to capital, which diminished from 1960 to 197], butwent up heavily from 1968 to 1977. However, it is more indicativeto compare the index of real compensation to workers in 19731977: while wages in 1973 were 100.0, by December of 1979 they
    wouId be 49.4. In the same period salaries went from 100.0 to
    71.7; while the legal minimum went from 100.0 to 60.5. Theseigures show the evident deterioration in the compensation ofworkers. However. these data are calculated based on a rate ofinflation which in reality is smaller that the real inflation rate
    Therefore, the buying power of the masses of workers would stillbe less, and the misery and hunger would be more
    Parallel to the above, the serious problem of unemploymentdevelops in 1976 absolute unemployment was 5.2% of the EAPand sub employment was 43.9%; by 1977 6.0% were unemployedand 46.0% sub employed; but by 1978 unemployment reached

    The countryside deserves special attention in these figures. Ten
    ears after theAgrarian Law, the redistribution of land has
    reached 21. 1% of the cultivated land and 7.7% of the cattle andaccording to some calculations, it would only affect about 347 ofthe totalin of agrricultural workers and "it can be said that onemillion of minifundia owners with less than three hectares(7.5acres )have been totally left out in the reassignment of lands. Butthe problem doesn't end there. Today, one thousand enterprisesare managed by the State(that previously was ten thousand farmsor estates). More than 50% of them are in crisis, with no profitsat all, cannot even pay the minimum salaries and lack the mostbasic management organization. Besides, the countryside hastransferred "17 billion of soles for payment of the agrarian debtalmost 10 billion in direct taxes and several billion more as Profitin enterprises such as EPSA, EPCHAT, ENCI, PNATAENACO, state monopolies for the commercialization ofagricultural and ranching products.

All the other forms, such asorganizations and struggles of the masses of people, are also veryimportant and absolutely indispensable, and in no way shouldthey are cast aside.

    In this society, there was a time in which darkness prevailed. Itdoes not imply that everythIng was darlk、 but it means thatdarkness prevailed. In our country, in our America, there is an oldand long tradition and a slow history which should be known. Weneed to search for the profound roots of who we are, not becausewe are nationalists, but because we have historical particularitiesand nobody can make revolution if they do not have historicalroots. We are an old society
    Some twenty thousand years ago, man arrived in these lands in avery primitive state; ten thousand years passed. In about four tosix thousandrears they began to develop agriculture and basic

    shelter to protect themselves from extreme weather conditionsand they also started sewing covers to protect their bodies. Twotousand years later we already had very productive agricultureand became a great agrarian system. The community develops

T'hus, the people were dividedbetween the oppressors and the oppressed. Also, these lands weredivided into small regions, big confederations and kingdoms
    Huari is an example. Time passed and the Incan empire wasormed. Then came Inca Pachacutec who brought more imperialorder and reorganized the State, making it stronger. This showsthat in ancient Peru there were nations that exploited others. The280

    existence of classes was evident, there were the exploited andexploiters. However, such a petrified kingdom did not last long
    Strange men came and destroyed the existing agrarian order. Butit is not true that the people of the Americas fell on their knees
    People resisted and defended the system of exploitation that thehad created, but it was a rotten system based on exploitation, andit collapsed when confronted with a superior order
    Thus, in our country the system collapsed and a long and vicious
    Process of feudal exploitation began. OurPeople were taken tothe mines, their blood was transformed into gold and silver for
    Europe. We view the development of European capitalism as theproduct of thee fesh and blood of our ancestors
    Centuries passed and a system of mestizaie develops. There wererebellions, especially the mobilization and uprisings of thepeasants in the Xvlli Century, which rocked thee system to Itsfoundations. The worldwide actions of capitalism prosper alongwith the spirit of emancipation of the masses; and since classes arenot eliminated and the problems of land and sovereignty areunresolved, these two old problems continue to persist
    The XIX Centuryinvolved the transformation of the feudal orderto a semi-feudal order. and from a colonial order to a semi-colonial one. We changed masters from one group of Europeansto another, from Spanish hands into English ones.

    II. How the Light Emerged and the Steel Was Forged
    The working class emerged, a new class was born. It was theworking class and the international proletariat that was alsoexpressed as the proletariat in our country. That is who we are
    The proletariat begins to illuminate the darkness, it is the
    that is represented here. This light was transformed into stc class
    From 1885 to 1919 there were nearly 30 years of intense classstruggle in which thele Peruvian proletariat begins to develop and

    proletariat and peasants allowed the forging of Marxism and Jose
    Carlos Mariategui, who fought like few others in these lands ofthe Americas. Our people are not frivolous, as some ignorantpeople say, we have produced many great people. Mariategui isone of the few men in these lands who applied Marxism-leninismto the special conditions and our people begin to find a newuntraveled road. A new and more pure light emerges, a shininglight That nght we carry in our hearts and souls. That light wasfounded with the land and that soil became steel. From light, soiland steel springs the founding of the Party in 1928. The steel wasforged, that is what we are. That is the problem of how the lightemerged and the steel forged
    In 1928 we were founded and we have never fallen into thecriterion of forming another Party. We
    ave come to an
    agreement that here the class and mass struggle gave birth to a
    Jose Carlos Mariategui who founded the Party, he gave us lightand steel and led us on our own way. Since then there has been282

    light and steel in our country. No matter what they say we can
    never go back.
    It is impossible to turn back while there are still classes. That lightwill not go out while there are still classes; the steel will not meltwhile there are still classes. But we had a possibility which cameapart when the life of our founder was cut short. Although it wasnegated, distorted and concealed, the unaccomplished task of
    Mariategui remained as our Program and Plan, the classembodied it. it continued beatin8

    Time passed. The Second World War came, the most extensiveone in history, which marked us and created a more profoundbureaucratic capitalist system and a more intense class struggle
    The working class kept advancing but never in peace, always inthe midst of torments and storms; it was forged with more lightmore steel, more strength and invincibilit

Thekey was the First National Conference, a milestone marking thebeginning of a new chapter. The spirits were joyful and our evesglistened with light. One chapter willsav: we carried a heavburden, we gave our quota, and in difficult moments we buriedour dead, we dried our tears, but continued fighting. ThisIS howit happened, and the People's Republic was proclaimed, a nationalholiday. Once again the work was recovered bringing Joy amongus. The countryside became more productive and freedom beganto palpitate in our people, with the red banner guiding us forever

    I. The Masses Clamor to Organize the Rebellion
    Since ancient times, the masses have been subjected toexploitation and oppression. They have always rebelled, it is along and inexhaustible history. The class struggle is constant. Itcannot be suppressed. For ages, since they began struggling, themasses have clamored to organize the rebellion, to be armed, torise up, to be led. It has always been this way and will continue tobe. Even afterwards. in the new world. there willl be strugge butin different forms
    Misery exists together with fabulous riches. Even the utopiansknew that both are inked; enormous wealth tied to condemnableand flagrant poverty. It is like this because exploitation exists
    Exploitation is tied to oppression and this too exists, killing themasses, consuming them with hunger, shackling and garrottingthem. But the masses are not sheep. They are people grouped intoclasses who organize themselves, develop their parties and thelatter its leaders
    The leadership should listen to the most minor murmur of themasses, listen to their movement, try to scan the future from adistance and stand firmly on the ground in order to record theintest tremor of the masses. A eader that does not do this is not
    a eader

In this way thedisorganized power of the masses expresses its strength, itsinvincible power, and the masses become the creators of neworders, thereby undermining and boisterously toppling thestrongest walls
    We can not calll ourselves Communists if we do not act in such amanner. There can be no leaders who are deaf to the clamor ofthe masses, blind to their strength, harsh or indifferent. This isunacceptable. Nevertheless, what have we seen? Blind, harshadifferent and deaf leaders; are they losing their status as
    Communists? The souls of Communists should tremble like thesouls of the masses tremble, should become happy with what
    rings
    hem joy, be hurt by what hurts them, become
    Impassiond by what impassion them, uplifted by what uplifts

    More and more we must be advisors, we should see things inperspective, have sensitive ears to hear what the masses have tosay, a penetrating insight, a sharp and piercing talent to diScoverthe transformation of the masses. Without this, we cannotaccomplish our mission. Should we follow the road of the oldopportunism? Do we have the callous hearts of reaction? Fromthose comrades who act that way what can we expect tomorrow?
    They are dark and sinister opportunists who traffick with thmasses. Never again shall we allow such a thing to occur, much

    Engels taught us that there are two forces in the world, the armedforce of reaction and the disorganized masses. If we organize thepowerful force of the masses, their potential develops into actionswhat was a possibility becomes a reality. What is a law and anecessity becomes forceful deeds which sweerPaway all that isbelieved to be firm. Nothing is permanent. Everything is a houseof cards, if it is not sustained by the masses. And when the massesspeak up everything shudders, the order begins to tremble, theigh summits stood and the stars change their course, because themasses are capable of anything

    must never happen again. If a Party has leaders who are deaf tothe masses, its days are numbered! If it occurs, our duty is tocrush and destroy such a bureaucratic machine since it is not a
    Party any longer, but a monster that must be dismantled. Whatdid Chairman Mao tell us on this matter? He said. we atheistshave only one divinity, the masses; we invoke those Gods in orderfor them to hear us so when that happens exploitation wil beliminated. We must forge our militants with this view todamore than ever, and even more so tomorrow
    The masses clamor to organize the rebellion. Therefore, the Partits leaders, cadres and militants have an urgent obligation anddestiny: to organize the disorganized force of the masses and this
    Wll only be accomplished with arms in hands. The masses must

    It is good to pause for a few minutes and ask ourselves. How havewe arrived at this great determination to develop themilitarization of the Party through actions? It has been in themidstofan Intense struggle, perhaps It has notot been as strident as
    others, but it is deeper, more turbulent and it has a very wide
    erspective
    T
    ositions have been in clear contention
    nose of us who
    since the VI Plenum have inculcated the idea of converting wordsinto actions, today convert the verb into armed actions. That is adecisive materialization and transcendental development. Whatwe have agreed upon is to develop military actions, which ring inour minds, palpitate in our hearts, clamor in our heads andagitates our wills when we speak about action
    Some of us have struggled for agreement on passing over to thelanguage of military actions and others have obstinatelyly opposedthis with sophisticated maneuvers and even slyness. But thisdecision has been imposed on us and determined because ourcountry demands determination, because our people demandactions. Our people clamor and we respond to that cry, to theirdemand, we feel what they feel and want what they want, theywant their hands to speak the precise and convincing language ofarmed deeds. Yes! Developing actions are always the deeds of themasses, of the people: when the trench is dug it is the action thatspeaks, when the anvil is forged it is the action that speaks, whenmen investigate they derive laws, it is the action that speaks andwhen armed hands are raised it is the people who fight. Firstcomes the deed and then the idea. and that idea will carrry you tohigher levels of action each time. We are sure and just reflectionsof our reality. We have preached extensively, called to arms forthe armed struggle. Our voices have not fallen in the desert, theseed fell in a good furrow and has begun to sprout. The voices welaunch are ver

And each dawe will continue to progress and do more. Either we fulfill ourromises or we will become the laughing stock and unfaithful
    Ptraitors. And surely we are not these
    If we have planted, preached and organized and all this bearsuit, then our obligation is to lead, because the march has begun
    Let the armed actions confirm our words. May our blood beoined with the blood of those who must shed it, we don't havethe right to let that blood shiver alone, let its frigidity mix withthe warmth of our own. or else we are not what we are
    In an almost insensible form we became Communists. It is ikelong trail, like walking. Moving with one foot demands you stepwith the other and if you get tired, it is not to straggle but to take
    a smoooth and calm rest, and then continue climbing. Tomorrow

    people, it is theLeir dream of fire and steel, but that sinister dream isthe most obvious proof that it is in decomposition
    And when comrades and leaders want to steal our souls andminds, should we permit
    No. Their arguments"went up in
    smoke,
    their threadbare considerationsand their paper

    Never again in our Party should we have to listen to those sinistervoices among Communists and even less so among leaders. Andall those daring to stand up, crush and destroy them like theydeserve. Today this is much more urgent, this is less permissiblenow because it is undermining and destroying the hopes of themasses, the labor of five years, and precisely when the massesbegin to express themselves concretely in reality. In these timesthese pacifists are shameful
    Many lessons are obtained for all of us from these meetings, forsome there should be deafening warnings and forceful calls to ourattention. Never again. We have a clear and definite orientationlet actions speak. To Develop the Militarization of the Partythrough actions. To convert this into reality is an urgent task.

    There are those who have opposed, resisted, and even someonewho fled in cowardice, deserting for a second time, and who hasbeen defended. Will it be useful for our Party to defend cowardiceand betrayal? Think of those who have committed such acts
    Remember "Prometheus" the Oceanids and Hermes: we ask for
    ng except cowardice and betrayal. Like 2, 500 years ago
    Communists in the XX Century in a Communist Party thatstrives for the launching of armed struggle, debating itsdevelopment through armed actions, we heard leaders who
    Praised, supported, nourished, and protected betrayal. Will thispolitical behavior be of any use to us? No. Let us root outpoisonous weeds. It is pure poison, a cancer which corrodes andwe must not permit this. It is a sinister and
    s that we
    must never allow within our ranks. much less now. Let us removethese sinister, harmful vipers. We can permit neither cowardicenor betrayal; they are asps. It is impossible to tolerate this. Itmanifests itself within us and in our leaders. This is unacceptablecondemnable and marked for fire. We must begin to root out thatpoison. We must forge ourselves in another temperament andth another spirit. Let us root out and burn the leeches

    It is urgent and pressing to finish with this. We must not leave a

    Servethis purpose, clarified
    ified with facts
    Those who have exhibited that behavior should be the first onesto leave. It will be a sign of our advancement.

Let us take this challenge verryserious

    There is no need to call those with problems powerless. Powerwill come from actions. Action is the toppling of the walls. Let us
    carry out mmilitaryactions. We will be tempered by them. From
    e novices we are we wiill become experienced combatants
    Thus, by arpplying the development o

    We need a great deal of optimism and there is a reason for it. Weare the makers of tomorrow, we are guides, the garrison of theinvincible triumph of the class. This is why we are optimists
    We are enthusiastic by nature. We are nurtured by the ideology ofour class: Marxism-leninism Mao Tse-tung Thought. We live thelife of the class. We participate in its heroic deeds. The blood ofour people flow and burns within us
    We are like a powerful and palpitating blood. Let us take theunbendable iron and steel, the class, and mix it together with theunwithering light of Marxism-leninism Mao Tse-tung Though
    Enthusiasm means to participate in the force of the Gods296

    therefore, we are full of enthusiasm. We Participate in theivinities of the real world: The masses. the class. Marxism andthe revolution. That is whywe have inexhaustible enthusiasm
    That is why we have strength, optimism, and a vigorous spirit
    overflowing withenthusiasm
    And what have we seen here? Militants and eaders withoutoptimism. Dead spirits and deciduous wills with flletting passions.
    This is unacceptable. We know well their roots: Their support isnot Marxism. the class. nor the masses, rather it is the corrosiveindividualism, the reactionary rot that makes them fearful, thesewage mold of the old order, thee expression oof the dying world,the lethal swamp gasses of reaction. This is why their spirits arebroken, their hearts tremble, their thoughts forsake them, theirnerves are destroyed, and their actions disturbed
    This has to be uprooted, it can not nest among us. It isunacceptable, inadmissible, let us burn it and blast it. This cannotbe allowed in the Party, much less prevail. What have we seen inthis moment? Leaders with these positions and attitudes. It is
    espicable. Never again should this happen. And plrecisely toda
    when we need to unfurl optimism and enthusiasm, now? That isunacceptable. It is corrosion, pure gangrene, and it should neverhave taken place, today it is much more unacceptable
    If the comrades dont uproot these weaknesses what typee o
    cadres arethey going to form? What kind of militants are they
    going to form? Apply the following: a company always reflects itsleadership. To lead a company without optimism results in acompany without optimism. A pusillanimous leadership makes apusillanimous company.It will be defeated and broken before it
    engages In Battle

    powerful ideology, incisive line and Communist will must bemanifested above alll in the leaders
    The order of the day is: Unfurl optimism and overflowenthusiasm! May it be shared with others, with our cadres andbases not present in this meeting. May this enthusiasm manifestitself in action and motivate us in order to eliminate the crust thatimpedes our advance and serve to others as an example to uprootthese weaknesses. May the optimism shine, and manifest in us apowerful enthusiasm. It is practical and necessary in as much as
    we carry It out
    No one can deny that this is a struggle between positions. Wehave recorded right here and the summary will be the expressionof what we have seen. But in the first place, what was importantin our Party? What is important now? What will be importanttomorrow? It is the Left. Who cries about its defeat? The Right
    They should understand that its cry is useless. They must burntheir old idols, burn the old and decrepit, and place their spiritsup to the these times
    The spirit of the times is owned by the Left. It is consistent withthe needs of our country, our people clamor for revolution. Wecannot fail. If our blood and ilves are clalmed, our response Is: wecarry our lives in our hands to give them up, we put them at theservice of the greatest and most iust cause
    Our death for the good cause should be thee sea o
    our
    revolutionary action. The constant and firm actions for our causeil be the hallmark of our lives as Communist combatants. Thisis what we have understood the best. That is why the positive

    Another world is opening up for us. We have begun to define it
    ourselves,this meeting is one of definition. Let every though
    word, action, feeling, and will of ours affirms this. It is feasibleindispensable and necessary. We can and must do it. And we willbecause we know what we want
    This meeting is very good, it has united and bonded us evenmore. We have unanimously agreed to uphold the military lineand its realization: Develop the Militarization of the Partythrough actions. "From now on, let everything express our taughtwillingness to carry out what we have agreed upon
    In the history of the world there have been no wars that beganand ended with a continuous victorious offensive. If theere werethey were an exception. That is true even in common wars. Butwhen the fate of a class is at stake. when the alternative iscapitalism or socialism, is there a basis or logic to suppose that anation which confronts this problem for the first time canimmediately discover the correct method, free of errors? Whatreasons are there to suppose this? None! Experience teach us thecontrary. None of the problems we faced could be resolved atonce
    but only after repeated attempts. To suffer a defeat,commence anew, redoing everything. To discover the method forthe approximate solution-a definitive solution or at least asatisfactory one-that is how we have been working and shouldcontinue to do so. Given the challenges that are presented to us, ifthere were no unanimity in our ranks, it would be a sad indicatorof a weak and very dangerous spirit that had penetrated the Party
    On the contrary, if we do not fear speaking the truth, no matterow hard and bitter it is, we will learn. And it is entirely certainthat we will learn to overcome each and every difficulty

    We are the initiators and we should keep this fact deepl
    In our
    spirits. This meeting is historic
    Comrades, we will pass into history as the initiators. For sometime, the Party has been writing this history on indestructible

    We are the initiators. This first Party Military School is both aseal and a breach, it concludes and begins. It concludes the timeof peace and opens the time of war. Comrades, our tasks withunarmed hands have concluded, and today our armed wordsbegin: Let us uplift the masses and peasants under the unfadingfags of Marxism-leninism Mao Tse-tung Thought. One periodhas ended and the preparations for the new one have concluded
    From here, the paast deeds are sealed and we open the future. Theey of the future is determined by actions, the objective is power
    This we shall do, history demands it, the class urges it, the peoplehave foreseen and want it. We must accomplish it and it will beaccomplished. We are the initiators

However, throughout history, the masses wereabandoned and had no direction. Their words, protests, actionsand rebellions were crushed and defeated. But the masses neverlost hope. The class always has hope. The masses are the light ofthe world that forge themselves ahead. They transform and createinstruments with their own hands. They are the social fabric, theinexhaustible beat of history. Thus, they have been generatingideas. science of the most adyanced kind
    But the laws of history that came about as a result of thedevelopment of the class struggle have generated one last class
    The international proletariat. The class has surged uIp strugglingin the midst of a sinister system, capitalism, which appeearesweating blood and muck from all its pores. A system in whosecenter the combative proletariat developed unions, strikesresistance and revolutions. Al of this became embodied in
    Marxism, and the class, endowing itself with a Party, evolved intoa mature class with its own interests. The masses of the worldfinally have their liberator. In the old times, the masses awaitedfor a liberator. They used to put their faith in the hands ofsupposed saviors, untilthe powerful and invincible proletariatappeareed, which is capable of creating a true new order.

    Around the Second World War, the revolution entered a strategicequilibrium, leaving behind the reactionary holy alliances andtheir previously untouchable tormentors and enemies. With thepowerful international workers' movement, the cresting waves ofthe national liberation movements, the development of
    Communist Parties. and the elevation of Marxism to the hisummit of Mao Tse-tung Thought, a new situation has beencreated: We are entering the strategic offensive of worldrevolution. In the next 50 to 100 years, the

    The imperialist superpowers, U.S.A., U.S.S.R., and other powersseek to invade, penetrate, suffocate, destroy and drown everythingwith terror. But as Chairman Mao said, by attacking, assaulting,and launching offensives they overextend themselves and enterthe powerful core of the people. The people rise up, armthemselves and rebel, putting nooses on the necks of imperialismand reaction. The people take them by the throat, threaten theerlives and will strangle them out of necessity. The reactionary meatwill be trimmed of fat, they will be torn to tatters and rags, the
    Scraps sunk into mire, and the remainders burned. The ashes willbe thrown to the winds of the world so that only the sinisterreminder of what must never return will remain

Reaction, which unleashes itsbloody claws tearing the flesh off the people, continues to sowdiscord, embroil, and seeks to sate itself with the blood of thepeople. But the peoples blood ascends like

It has no other destiny than to serve therevolution and put itself at the disposal of the proletariat.

    experience we should particularly win over the intellectuals. As
    Mariategui has already shown us, the masses must be mobilizedand only in this manner will we will fulfill our role and serve thegreat battle that histor
    as arranged for us
    Comrades, we have concluded that we are embarking into thethird epoch of contemporary Peruvian society. But iust asyesterday, when we expounded upon the two moments ofcontemporary Peruvian history as part of the process of thedevelopment of bureaucratic capitalism in this country, somecondemned us and rejected our thesis and ideals with insolenceand contemptible accusations of infantilism. We are putting forthtoday, with a clear and precise vision, that our country enters athird epoch. This thesis will also be subiected tmisunderstanding. But it is no onger possible to condemn us306

    with childish labels of infantilism, because this time, history hasshown us to be right in many things, and they will alsSo earnlessons [translator: this refers to the two line struggle within the
    Party). Nevertheless, it is not easy for our accusers to easily acceptand comprehend it. It requires convincing deeds, concrete actionsthat pound into their hard heads and shatter their speculation to
    Pieces, so that they also may carry the reality of this country intheir spirits
    The understanding of the third epoch is key to the advance of ourpeople. What does the third epoch

    at reaction will try to contain us and oppose the
    advance of the revolution. It is well known by materialists thatwhat exists refuses to die: reaction exists and therefore refuses todie. It is an unburied corpse but it protests, negates, resists, andattacks with fury and desperation, opposing its placement into acasket for its burial
    Thus, we must understand that the revolutionary struggle will behard, violent and cruelly contested by reaction. They will sentheir sinister army armed to the teeth to fight us, assaultingworking class, the peasants and popular masses, spreading theirsinister claws. They will try to encircle, isolate, crush and wipe usout. But we are the future, the strength, and history
    Comrades, revolution and counterrevolution are also contendingtorces in our country. They are two parts of a unity of oppositesin constant struggle. The reactionaries are armed andconcentrated, defending the metropolis and capitals. We are

    rooted in the countryside, in small villages, with the masses,especially with the poor peasants, with the force of the people
    amonng their disorganized force in order to organize it into a
    powerful army. But this will not be easy. The dark, sinister armiesof reaction will fight against us, mount powerful aggressions andgreat offensives. We will respond in kind, splitting them, makingthem fal apart, and converting their offensives into a multitude ofour small offensives. Therefore. those who encircle wil beencircled. the would-be annihilators wil be annihilated. thewould-be victors will be defeated and the beast will fina

    That is what will happen. This is the way it is, Ceomrades
    Nevertheless, the fight will be hard, long, difficult and cruel. Weneed to steel our spirits, be strong, vigorous, fearless andconfident in our victory. May the confidence of victory dwell inour hearts in as much as we serve the people and class. Theroblem is to initiate thle armed struggle with decisiveness and

    We convert everything into our fire. The black fire will betransformed into red fire and the red is light. That is where weare, that is the Reconstitution of the Party. Comrades, we arereconstituted
    The Party is a Party of a new type. The purpose of this Party of anew type is to seize power for the working class and the people ofthis country. The Party can not be developed more but throuthee use
    of arms, through armed struggle. That is the hardesson
    we have learned in 50 years, a great lesson that we should never
    Chairman Mao has written, whoever has more guns A,'S. Likeorget: We have nopower because we have no gur
    power. Whoever wants to seize power must forge an army, andwhoever wants to keep power must have a powerful army. This iswhat we will accomplish. The Party has embarked to developitself through armed struggle, our historical course. We cannot go
    ackwards
    Comrades, we can now state that the development of the Palhas prevailed. Its possible destruction, as it had to be, has beenaverted This is the conclusion we can derive from the 2nd
    Plenary Session of the Central Committee and the First Military
    School. We have completed a task that we only now have begunto appreciate. We asked ourselves, how will we develop the Partv?
    A plain and simple response is: Through armed struggle. Incritical times the situation enters into contentious struggles, andaccording to the law of contradiction, specific circumstances canlead into development or destruction, of course transitory, but itdoes not cease to become a destruction if that could lead us tosink in the mud or march through a muddy place

    The Party has triumphed as it had to. Its destruction cannot takplace. The Party embarks firmly, decisively, voluntarily
    and
    energetically in its development. Comrades, this is what is derivedfrom these meetings. However, what contradiction is beingdebated? The launching of
    8
    armeed struggle presents a
    contradiction: The old versus the new. The development of the
    Party through armed struggle is the new, and the old is ouraccomplishments up to now, including the good ones. Even thebest of our achievements have aged, and no matter how much weadd to this tradition, we also add to that great garbage whichparties, classes and organizations generate throughout decades
    We must be very clear on this point. Thelere is only one new thing,to develop the Party through armed struggle. Today, thIS IS ourcontradiction. Just like in the international arena where thcontradiction is between the strategic offensive and the strategicefensive of reaction, in our country the contradiction 1s betweenthe armed people and armed reaction. This contradiction, througlthe People' s War, will inevitable lead to the triumph of the classand sweep away 400 years of oppression. Comrades, in the Partythere is also a contradiction. It cals for serious reflection and noone should doubt it
    Toda
    the Communists should be clear on the contradiction of
    the old versus the new. I reiterate, the new is the armed strugglethe unfading flames of Peoples War, the steel which must bemade purer, the
    larp sword and piercing spe
    spears in order to
    wound the entrails of reaction. This is new. Everything else is old,it is the past, and from that past we must guard ourselves, becausethe past always tries to reestablish itself in a thousand forms inthe future
    Comrades, let us not forget that in order to guaranteeconsolidation of 100, we need to advance as 200. Today,

    Evervthin8
    else is old. We should be absolutely clear and
    understand it. The Party has embarked on its developmentthrough arms. This is our fundamental situation. Having statedthis point, we have three conditions
    First, we embark on the strategic offensive of world revolution
    That is our situation. The revolutionary tide is on our side
    Second, the people set out to seize power with arms. The futureilll be decide.d throughth the advancement of Peoples War
    Third, the Party begins to develop through the armeed struggle
    Thus, the Party will become the powerful Party which therevolution needs, and since it is needed it must be forged
    Comrades, the world process, the process of the nation and the
    Party are interrelated. Therefore, the future is assured, it ispalpitating in thele armed actions that we will commence toundertake. It is a delicate task that needs to be nurtured with theclamor of our arms, developed with guerrilla warfare, fortifiedwith Peoples War, cared for and nourished like the seed of anarmy, giving birth to armed columns, allowing it to flourish into aguerrilla army that we must build into a powerful army
    Comrades, these three conditions determine that the Party leadsthe armed struggle of the masses In our hearts, minds and willsthe power of the people is alive, and we carry it with us. In thebeginning we have no rearguard or we will have one that is smalweak, fragile and uncertain. Comrades, we must never forget thepeoples power, the State of the working class, the State ofworkers and peasants. This State marches with us, we carry it on

Comrades, thearmed struggle will be born fragile and weak because it is new,but its destiny will be to develop through change, from thevarlation of fragility like a tender plant. The roots we plant at thebeginning will be the future of a vigorous State. Comrades, allthis begins to flourish with the modest and simple actions thattomorrow we will carry out

    This is a derivation from the three issues discussed above. It isogical, necessary, irrefutable and irreversible conclusion. On theree previous issues, the Party in the Second Plenary Session of

    this school? If the Second Session of the Central Committee is the
    Chime of Glory, what is this school? We will repeat it oncemore, it is "the Seal and Breach, because it closes and opens. Itconcludes our unarmed life and begins our Peoples War
    Comrades, that is this school. Here we have applied theagreements of the Second Plenary Session of the Central
    Committee. We have successfully completed and resolvedproblems, that the Central Committee shall ratify very soon, atthe same time it arranges for the Partys readjustment and thecommencing of actions
    Thus, the Party, through its central organizations, its leaders andcadres, arms itself with the military line in theory and practice
    Comrades, the last meeting is a demonstration of the distributionof forces: proof of the encirclement and annihilation of pessimismand opposition. It has burned and annihilated what among us andinside of us could have opposed. We have raised up optimism and
    are
    filled with enthusiasm. The victories to come have beenunfurled. We must understand it in this way. We have seen the
    Ighters march, we have seen advanced tighters wit
    eir leaders
    at the foreground, opening breaches; we have seen the ranksmarch in order to maintain and support the actions. We haveseen at last the definitive action, a passionate and ardent faith toreach the summit. What we have done today is a demonstrationof how to act militarily. That is why we say we are armingourselves theoretically and practica.
    n this manner, arming the
    cadres and leaders for basic effectiveness. we have obviouslentered the general political mobilization. Remember what
    Chairman Mao said: the key is to mobilize the cadres. That hasbeen accomplished. The mobilization has begun, and what wehave achieved here will be reverberated tomorrow in morepowerful waves, because the masses yearn to hear the Party saythat we should begin to take action and they want to know howto do this. Comrades, let us inform the bases of the good news314

    Comrades, the general political mobilization of the Party is on themarch. Forming armed detachments and developing militaryactions we initiate the armed struggle. This begins from here, andthat is why this meeting is both a seal and a breach
    VI. We Are the Initiators
    We are the initiators. We began by stating we are the initiators.
    And we end by stating we are the initiators. Initiators of what? Ofthe Peoples War and the armed struggle that is in our handsshining in our minds, beating in our hearts and irrepressiblyagitating in our wills.

    contradictions? Yes, they do. Here, in the Party, the focus is onour agreement concerning the"Development of the Militarizationof the Party through actions"and in applying our Plan of
    Initiation is the essence of the new, a new part of the world whichcannot be detained because our armed hands have surged withmore to follow tomorrow. The new is focused in our country, thearmed solution, and the Partys develodment through armsintensifies through the armed struggle. Thus, on the question ofdeveloping and applying the plan of initiation, the new is thefocus and the old is confronted. The old will pledge itself to theopposite, but it is already defeated, it is a great defeat for the
    Right. Their destruction is already assured, the development hastriumphed, let us shape it through thunder, write it with lead, sothat it remains written forever on pages of steel upon the ridge ofthe mountains: so that it can never be erased nor written in acontrary form. That is the contradiction
    the end, everythingreduces to a fifthProblem. Thecontradiction enters to address the problems of arms, war, armedstruggle and how to initiate it. If up to now we have acted as anunarmed people, the problem now is that we begin to act witharmed hands. From times of peace to times of war. And the timesof war have other requirements and other urgent demands
    Comrades. the contradictions willl accumulate but we wil haandethem. We have learned to handle history, the

    of us have a problem, a contradiction: the great rupture
    Comrades, the time has come. It is time for a great rupture. Wwilll break all ties with what is old and rotten in order tocompletely and thoroughly destroy it, for if we have an interest inat decrepit world, we would not be able to destroy it. Menspeaking Individually
    lly can be weak. Each of us should think hard
    As an individual, each person can be fragile and weak. But the
    revolution is all-powertul, and the armed revolution even more so
    because it is sustained by the masses, who are the force of theand and led by the Party, which is the light of the universe
    Comrades, webegin the great rupture. We have stated manytimes that we embark upon that rupture and that many ties shalbe broken since it links us to the old and rotten order. and if wedon't do it. we could never demolish it. Comrades, the time hascome, there is nothing more to discuss, the debate has beenexhausted. It is time to act, it is the moment of rupture and it willnot be done with slow and tardy meditation, nor in the halls norin silent rooms. It will be done with the roar of armed actions
    This is the form for carrying it out, a correct and adequate form,
    e onlv formIt is through actions, as we have studied, that the
    conscious capacity of people intensifies, the will is tenser, ourpassions more powerful and our energy enraged
    omrades
    rough actions we will find the energy, force, and sufficientcapacity for the great rupture. We have embarked upon this. Thetrumpets begin to sound, the murmur of the masses grows and itwill continue growing, it will deafen us, it will bring us to apowerful vortex, with one note: We will become the protagonistsof history, conscious, organized and armed. Thus, the greatrupture will be open and we will become the makers of adefinitive dawn. This is what we have embarkedP

    It is the synthesis of what we done up to now. It shapes all thepast. Cocomrades, what has guided us? To initiate the armedstruggle, was not this stated in the Ninth Plenum?

    its tirst phase it made advances in obtaining its objectives, but theeconomic crisis generated by itself, and especially the persistentstruggle of the masses, forced the military government toreexamine its obiectives and limit itself to a general readjustmentof its plan to subsequently proceed with the corporate344

Nevertheless, the deepening of theeconomic crisis and the intensification of the class strugge cutshort their gooas, andthe new constitution, thus representing thethird reorganization of the Peruvian state in this century did notachieve the molding of a corporate Peruvian society. It onlallowed for the strengthening of executive power at the expense ofthe parliament, and a greater Participation of the armed forces inthe running of the state.

    see clearly the revolutionary situation manifesting itself and how
    Lenin understood it: today those on top can no longer continueruling as they did yesterday, and those on
    e bottom are no
    longer willing to live as they have until now. In the reactionarcamp, we can see the lack of a precise and defined acceptableprogram capable of welding the reactionary forces and the erraticjumble of moves and counter moves that betray the lack of a fixed
    course, the un@erstandable result Oof the lackOI a ur

    revolutionary transformation, although as a limitation theysometimes may express themselves in a simple desire tooverthrow the decrepit ruling system. But still, if this was all therewas to it, this is the basic and enough reason to meet the correctcourse of action, because it is the armed struggle itself, through itsaccomplishments, that open even wider the road of armedstruggle and, likewise, shows in deeds the correctness of this roadin the minds of peeodle, and

This is, in synthesis, the current situationof both the people and the reaction. The latter propose, througte government of Belaunde, a"social pact"or"concertation(reconciliation or class collaboration )which is nothing more than
    of the position of the previous government, but the
    eople's position in perspective is: support the armed struggle

    Thus, today the class struggle is polarized and will continue to bepolarized even more in the future: "concertation"vs. support forle armed struggle.

    Reconciliation is the flag of reaction bent on binding the people'shands and feet, and, in more limited terms, to weld together thecontending factions in the reactionary camp. To achieve this, thereactionary regime wmilll resort to whatever means. includinrepression, with the obiective of maintaining their dominance. Inthe last resort they increase the use of armed force, since that iste card reaction keep up its sleeve for the opportune moment
    Support for the armed struggle is the red flag of the people andmust be their necessary perspective since, for the people,reconciliation is capitulation. The road for our people begins tomanifest itself with greater clarity and dete

    starting from what is established since Marx. Because the ideolo8of the proletariat is a powerful science that develops itself throughbig leaps, generators of higher stages each time: with Marx,
    Marxism, with Lenin. Leninism and with Chairman Mao
    Maoism, as the first, second and third successive stages, Marxism
    Leninism-maoism, and, mainly, today's Maoism
    Therefore the obiecive is to develop a campaign that Possessesstrategical characters and serves the world revolution. Due to thecircumstances the contribution that we can make is important, wedo not say that it is decisive, but it is important within the contextin which we unfold ourselves. Lets not pretend to telll Historywhat to do. she is the one that througn Class struggle establishesthe laws and defines the situations. It is possible that our own
    Party or others can give a decisive contribution
    In this moment it is more necessary than ever for us to talk of
    Maoism, and obviously we cannot do it without referring to thestruggle at the world level against revisionism; therefore it is vitaland urgent to analyze Maoism again, aiming to define more andbetter it contents and meaning, guided by the judgement that tohoist, defend and apply Maoism is the essence of the struggetween Marxism and revisionism in the present
    We must think how to develop multiple campaigns in order toobtain solid results and of long perspective. And in this way tounfold the instruction of militants. combatants and masses. and tostrive to divulge Marxism starting from the transcendence of thepeople's war that he himself guided. The problem is to put inmotion the ideological dynamics. We look foreward to contributeto the defense of what is peremtory to defend: Marxism-leninism

    it today, leading the Peruvian people. There is no other solution
    The fact is that Peru today is a semifeudal and semicolonialsociety in which a bureaucratic capitalism is developing, a delavedcapitalism linked to the big landowners. interests and which,consequently, in no way seeks the destruction of semifeudalconditions but at most seeks its evolution. What is moreimportant, it is a type of capitalism completely subjugated toimperialism, in our case principally Yankee imperialism, and

    On the contrary, it is completely at thee service of Imperialism Sincreasing exploitation and is totally against the national interestsof the majority of the population, and the basic and urgent needs
    of our people
    Thus, the modern Peruvian economy was born deformed and illat its roots. It was born intrinsically tied to the archaic semifeudalsystem which, despite the regimes bragged-aboutagrarianreforms, "continues to exist and characterizes the country from itsmost basic foundations to its most elaborate ideas. This situationmaintains, in essence, the great land problem, the driven force ofhe peasants class struggle, especially the poor peasants that madeUD the immense maiority. Moreover, the Peruvian economy wasorn subjugated by imperialism, the last phase ot capitalismmasterfully characterized as monopolistic, parasitic, and
    moribund
    Although thiS Imperialism

    Therefore, the modern economy, the bureaucratic capitalism, istied to the unburied cadaver semi feudalism, and it is subjugated

    This is our reality, this is the foundation on which Peruviansociety rests and the material roots of our problems and themisfortunes of our people.

    Politically, the Constitution of 1979, just like with the rest of itstype, denies each right it recognizes in its contents. It did notsatisfy even the factions of the reactionary camp, much less the
    People, for that reason modifying it is, and will continue to be, anarena of contention. The present Constitution gives directarticipation to its armed forces andpolice in every aspect ofsocial life, strengthening their domain, at the same time itempowers the faculties of the Executive and organizes the mostrepressive police system in our history. Despite all its filthydemagoguery, the current Constitution is the harshest and moreviolent and bloody shock that a Constitution has ever had withour conditions. This is shown by the contrast between the socalled "right to life and the sinister genocide being carried out
    Ith cruelty and impunity by the armed forces in the region ofyacucho, directed by Belaunde himself

Everyconquest won by the people has been wrested away in the courseof the peoples struggles. As a result of thelese struggles, laws wereenacted. From the beginning thele state started cutting back andinitiating a process to reduce the effects of these laws or do awaywith them entirely, as is shown in the history of labor legislationin the country. The victory of political rights has followed asimilar course. All of this clearly has been won outside the frameof the conquest of Power, since for a revolutionary, power is onl

    The Communist Party of Peru, a Marxist-leninist-maoist partyreconstituted combating revisionism, including within its ownranks, a party of the new type to conquer Power for theproletariat and the people, assumed its role of applyinrevolutionary violence by initiating the armed struggle on 17 May1980. Thus, the class struggle of the proletariat and thee people o
    Peru have taken a leap in its long journey. The political strugglecontinues as revolutionary war, taking armed struggle as therincipal form and the revolutionary armed forces as its maintorm of organization
    In this manner our party left behind a historical baggage, morethan 50 years old, and has overcome a dark and rotten electoralsm imposed on the masses With dynamite and bullets it beganto write the genuine peoples liberation, armed and united fromthe beginning with the people, mainly the peasants, who havelways supported the most heroic actions of the Peruvianrevolution, and do so today more than ever as thee armed strugglehas fulfilled the centuries old hope in an un extinguishablebonfire

    Despite the clamor which deemandedtheir participation in theanti-guerrilla warfare, the armed forces of the Peruvian State didnot enter the war directly until the end of 1982, due to theopposition of Belaunde, who was fearful that the military woulduse their participation to stage a coup d'etat against him or take

    DEVELOP THE PEOPLES WAR SERVINGTEE WORLD REVOLUTION
    A revolution must go through a civil war. This is a rule. And tosee only the ills of war but not its benefits is a one-sided view. Itis of no use to the peoples revolution to speak unilaterally or onesided of the destructiveness of the war
    It is good if we are attacked by the enemy, since it proves that wehave drawn a clear line of demarcation between the enemy andourselves. It is still better if the enemy attacks us wildly and paintsus as utterly black and without a single virtue. It demonstratesthat we have not only drawn a clear line of demarcation betweenthe enemy and ourselves but achieved a great deal in our work

    CONTEXT OE THE SXTH YEAR
    May 17 mark the sixth anniversary of the launching of th
    Peoples War in Peru. Six years ago the Communist Party took uparms to carry out the democratic revolution by overthrowing theexploitation and oppression of imperialism, mainly Yankeeimperialism, bureaucratic capitalism and the subsisting semifeudalism, in order to conquer power for the proletariat and thepeople, within the context and at the service of the worldrevolution. Since then. under the invincible banners of Marxism
    Leninism-maoism and Guiding Thought, we have march along
    e road of surroundin
    the cities from the countryside, and have
    been waging a revolutionary war taking the countryside and cityas a single unit with the countryside the principal theater ofarmed action and the complementary but necessary. In synthesis,

    Party, whose core is the generation of revolutionary base areas
    Thelese years of armed struggle can De summarizeed as follows: 1980was
    e Beginning o
    gof the armed struggle, of guerrilla warfare
    1981 and 1982 saw the unfolding of a guerilla struggle and thebirth of the Peoples Committees, the new political power ofworkers, peasants and petite bourgeoisie, a joint dictatorshipbased on the worker-peasant alliance led by the proletariatthrough its Party; 1983 and 1984 were years of struggle focusingon restoration and counter restoration, that is. ofcounterrevolutionary war that try to smash the new politicalpower and restore the

    develop and build the newly arising people's power, a hard-foughtstruggle waged between the reactionary Armed Forces and
    People's Guerrilla Army; from 1985 through today there haavebeen a continuing defense, development and building to preservethe base areas and expand the Peoples War throughout ourmountains from North to South
    Since 1983 the Peruvian revolution evolves under the greatpolitical strategic conception of Building Base Aeas anmilitary terms of developing Peoples War, which
    means

    guerrllla warfare complementeed by guerrilla actions
    such as sabotage, selective annihilation and propaganda andagitation, so as to carry out the central task of building,preserving and developing base areas and spreading the Peeople s
    War throughout the country, taking into account the variabilitythat the fluidity ofguerrilla warfare imposes not iust on the new
    g
    state power but on all forms of revolutionary construction andwork. This basic plan of"Building Bases" forms the context forthele present Plan for the Great Lead, based on the specific

These are two poles, one of the big beourgeoisieheading up the dictatorship of the ruling classes in th

Through the military strategyof generalizing Peoples War, this strategy has taken the concreteorm of four campaigns, each with its specific content
    ON THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY WAR
    Since every war is a struggle between two camps, the developmentf the Peoples War inevitably led to the unleashing ofcounterrevolutionary war. The Peruvian state, the dictatorship ofle big bourgeoisie and landlords underthle protection ofimperialism, principally Yankee imperialism, defended
    er
    threatened existence. At first they tried to minimize the problem
    In order to preserve their phony democratic image and not
    endanger
    e influx of capital In the torm of loans and
    investment. They sent in their police forces, which despite
    eir
    abuses, outrages and crimes suffered humiliating defeat and wereorced to withdraw from the countrvside in the disputed areas and
    seek refuge Inthe provincial or departmental capitals. Thus, all
    he police operations, launched with such loud and confusingpropaganda, were soundly defeated and the first People's
    Committees arose. In the face of the advance of the new stateower, the Belaunde government abandoned its reservations to

    Pasco. Huanuco and San Martin: it is still in force essentialldespite some variations. Military control reached a new andimportant phase with the imposition of a state of emergency andcurfew in Lima and Callao beginning in February 1986, whichsubjected the capital of the Republic and its more than six millioninhabitants to military rule.

    1970s. Based on these agents, infiltrators, spies and stool pigeons,

    sinister policy of burning all, looting all, and killing all
    Later, they used the white terror and death threats to subjugate apart of the masses, and in this way masses under direct vigilantecoercion and control were forced to aid the counterrevolutionarywar. These coerced people drafted from among the masses actedas guards, arrested and murdered guerrillas, carried out razingoperations against neighboring communities or towns and evenmore distant ones, and took part in search and pursuit operationsagainst the guerrillas. Later thesePeople were regrouped along
    Ith people from neighboring areas into strategic hamlets underdirect military rule. Then, in addition to being forbidden to comeand go freely, since they are not allowed to go anywhere withoutthe military, even to work, and subject to constant control, theywere militarized and organized into Datrolsand defensecommittees, forced to take up rudimentaLry weapons, and, sunkin starvation and poverty, obligated to take part militarily in thewhite terror and the counterrevolutionary war. In conclusionwhile the police forces were also used as cannon fodder bythe
    Armed Forces. as even the soldiers. sailors and aviators havealways been, these coerced masses have been the main and realcannon fodder in this sinister plan of pitting

    Genocide
    When their policy of masses against masses proved unable tocontain the People's War, the reactionary Armed Foorces resortedto the most evil, perverted and criminal genocide, one of thegreatest infamies in the history of the Republic of Peru. Themilitary showed its genocidal tendencies from the beginning, in
    Huambo, Iquicha, Huaychao, etc. Belaunde cynically saluted andapproved of these incidents as " the Ayacucho peasant's gallant

    They began to wipe out the peasants and their communities andsmall towns in 1983 in the department of Ayacucho. In June ofthat year, in Espite, in the province of Cangallo, theyusedhelicopters to strife the masses with gun fire, and throw grenades
    lagers who were trying to flee through the mountains. Inthe towns of Occopeja and Uchuraccay, in the province of
    Huanta, again they used helicopters to strife

    July, the first monstrously tortured bodies began to turn up in thestreets of the city of Avacucho and thele surrounding areas, duringthe two months leading up to the November elections, the bodies
    of morethan 800 people were found, people who had beeen
    brutally murdered after bestial tortures and their bodies left to rot
    In November, in Silvia, in the province of La Mar, in a reprisal foran ambush against the Army, they arrested 60
    eople and
    indiscriminately killed 20 of them. A month before, in Sillco, in
    e province oof Huanta, they threw grenades and fired directly on
    thee masses forthe first time. Culminating this slaughter, onelection day, in Socos, in the province of Huamanga, the localpolice detachment tortured and murdered more than 50 peoplewho had been taking part in a wedding party. Officially, 37people were reported dead
    Along with all this reactionary white terror, they began to set uconcentration camps in the department of Avacucho, massive andevil torture centers, under the control of the Army in thelos
    Cabitos barracks in the city of Ayacucho, in Totos(Cangalloand Qoisa and Pichari (La Mar), and under the control of the
    Navy in Huanta. In the Totos camp, as of July 1983 they hadsecre
    urled morethian a hundred people, morethan 20 of
    them had their throats cut, the prisoners were tortured and buriedalive, new prisoners were forced to dg graves morethan threemeters deep and then were shoved in, while others were thrownin with their hands and feet tied. In Totos the torture is especiallbrutal and sadistic. To terrify the people, they cut off heads andimpale them on stakes
    But the genocide was not confined to Ayacucho. In October 1983it spread to the department of Pasco, the country's mining centerthere, in Chinche, a hamlet of the province of Alcides Carrion, 45peasants were wiped out.

    During 1984 the genocide became macabre, reaching the heightsof horror. The Armed Forces, mainly, as well as the policeunleashed their evil. rotten, inflamed, blind and rabid hatredagainst the people, in their frustrated efforts to stoprevolutionary war by isolating the guerrillas from the masses ofpeasants, particularly thee Door Peasants. Once again, in their owntradition, the armed reaction fed upon the flesh and blood of theunarmedPeople. Lets look at some of the heroism"that servesto prop up their talse gloryand unfounded pride
    The genocidal slaughters
    In the department of Ayacucho at the end of June they killed 150people in the San Francisco area. July 5th, they killed 30 peasantsin Chiara; on the 8th, they killed 40 after an operation in thevillage Rosario; the 12th, they wiped out 30 people in
    Pomabamba; on the 15th, in a reprisal for an action at Apachetathey killed 17; the 16th, 25 tortured bodies were found alonggthehighway to Huamanguilla. August 3rd, the tortured bodies of 37people were found in Puramanta; on the 18th the corpses of 17tortured children and adolescents were found in Cocahuichun in
    Via de los Libertadores. and 8 bodies. two of them children. in
    Leonpata; the 27th, 19 people were found murdered in Sajrarumiand 21 in San Francisco. September 1st, 23 peasants were killed in
    Churrubamba and Misiquibamba. The same month, in Paraiso, in
    Mariscal Caceres province in the department of San Martin, theykilled 22 peasants. In the department of Huancavelica, betweenthe 15th and 23rd of October, an Army operation killed 75peasants in Milpo and 15 in Pilllo-pachamarca. November 19th396

    once again in Ayacucho, they wiped out 50 peasants in Putis and
    Chullay; in Lucmahuaico, Vilcabamba, in the department of
    Cusco, soldiers and vigilantes from Andahuaylas killed 22
    Peasants on the 23rd and 20 more on the 26th. Once again in
    Huancavelica, December 6th the police killed 38 peasants in
    Cuni, near Marcas in the province of Acobamba; the same month16 bodies were found in Avahuarcuna, in Avacucho
    Some actions that took place in June and July in Ayacucho as partof this sinister wave of genocide in 1984 should be specificallymentioned. In Vinchos, they killed 40commissioners of varlouspeople's committees. In Remillapata they shot a child nine yeasand another of 11 together with their mother and their fatherwho was the Security Commissioner; in Mayopampa they threw a
    commissioner Into aburning building. Theese vie murders, so
    merciless and ferocious that children are shot because thehappen to be the children of members of the new political power,is a monstrous expression of the hate and fear with which thisnew political power fills them. In Balcon 70 Marines came in andmurdered 18Peeasants. amon8them six children whose bodiesthey dumped in their trucks. A third of the dead were children,this murder of children is a constant policv to terrorize and breakthe parents, as well as a disgusting6 and often-used wapunishing revolutionaries especially. Nevertheless, the Marinescame back again the next day, sarcastically and contemptuouslyergtheir victims food, trying to buy them off. Thepeopleuite justly became enraged and drove them away. After anambush in Pichari, the glorious"Civil Guard came in andstopped a truck carrying passengers, who were taken offandkilled. Local forces of the People's Guerrilla Army (PG

    lese 20 people, but in

    attributed to the PGA. This is another common trick used by thereactionary forces who often disguise themselves in peasantclothes in order to commit atrocities, loot, rape, arson, razing and

    the most frichtful crimes, especially against children, and then
    g
    blame the guerrillas so as to turn the masses against them. Oneexample of this is the murder of 50 peasants by the Marines in aace cae
    Azangaro, 20 minutes from Luricocha, during thi
    same period
    Another example of their terror tactics took place in San
    Francisco, when peasants going down to the jungle to harvestwere indiscriminately wiped out, without even being asked fortheir identification papers. In Huamanguilla they killed ninepeasants, burning one peasant alive. That is one of their usualways of terrifying people by showing their mercilessness towardanyone considered a communist or a guerrilla
    A similar example happened in Chuschi, January 10, 1983, wherey tied dynamite to a peasant and blew him up while shouting,
    This is how terrorists die! "This barb
    arbaric policy has been
    implemented since the beginning of the Armed Forcesintervention and continues today. In this black wave of deathrazing became widespread. A small example Is the operation inncaraqay, where after stealing everything they burned down 500louses. The extermination made whole towns disappear; July 15the Armed Forces backed by vigilantes killed the entire populationof Quinua and completely wiped the town off the face of theearth. But even this was not enougch for them. The white terrorcontinued fattening on the peoples flesh. On August 22, 1984, ina reprisal for an ambush, a Marine unit in Silvia arrested 50 youthat random and shot them at the spotlight; emulating the Geermanascists who set Europe aflame during World

The broken lives ofthe people have fueled history's enraged clamor for class justice, ajustice that only the advancing armed revolution can and willbring about, as well as the constant and unsilenceable exposure ofthee barbarism wiith which the Peruvian state defends itself, usingits Armed Forces, under the leadershipPof whatever governmenthappens to be on duty, whether it is the Popular Action party of
    Belaunde or Alan Garcia s APRA. because what is at stake is theirclass dictatorship, their very order of exploitation and oppression
    In the department of Ayacucho on August 19, 1984, a grave with10 bodies was found in Via de Los Libertadores, and on the 22ndgrave wiiith 30 corpses along the Huanta-mayo road, 30kilometers from Huanta. On the 23rd seven common graves witha total of 89 bodies in an advanced state of decomposition weretound in Pucayacu, a discovery which profoundly shook publicopinion and unleashed the masses condemnation and repudiationf the Armed Forces and the Belaunde government then in
    The political military command of the region was in the
    hands of General Adrian Huaman and the officer directlresponsible for the massacre was Naval Captain Alvaro Artaza
    Garcia tried to reappoint Huaman as the chief of Ayacucho, and
    Barrantes used to call him "the peasant general. The trial of
    Captain Alvaro took place within the Navy itself, and the presentAPRA government gave him a promotion, closed his case andsent him to Spain for his own protection

    Then came a great hustle and bustle in parliament, a farce ofestures an
    so-caied presidential measures, while the
    opposition"rent their clothes and made easy deals, and theeople repudiated and condemned all this and advanced further
    Ptoward becoming clear about the highest ruling circles. Almost a
    year has gone by since then. Commands have been reshuffled
    Lieutenants Hurtado. Paz and Rondon have been heldresponsible; the various commissions have presented their reportsetc, etc. Today Hurtado has been given a promotion and sentabroad for further training, in the United States or somewhereunder U.S. control; Paz also got a promotion and Rivera willundoubtedly get one in 1987. What happened to the investigation,the indictments the Army was preparing8Buried under silence
    The sentence of 10 days hard labor the military investigatorsproposed for Lieutenant Hurtado, has it been carried out? Howabout justice? Just as in the case of Pucayacu, only the triumphantrevolution wil bring about iustice
    But this smokescreen of "fighting while upholding the

    THE SXTH ANNMERSARY OF THE PEOPLES WAR
    The application of Marxism Leninism-maoism to the concreteconditions of Peruvian society leads to the conclusion thatrevolutionary violence or violent revolution, the only way to seizestate power and transform the world, must take the form of
    People's War and more specifically a peasant war led by the
    Communist Party of Peru as the representative of the proletariata war which develops as a single unit waged principally in thecountryside and complementarily in cities, following the road of
    SurroundinIg the cities from thee countryside whose essence is the
    establishment of base areas. so that the democratic revolutionculminates in the establishment of Peoples Republic, a greatvictory which must be followed by continuing the revolutionthrough socialism and cultural revolutions, underthe dictatorshipof the proletariat with the firm exercise of its class violence, untiachieving, together with all humanity, glorious communism, therealm of true freedom. Based on the above, there are fourfundamental questions that arise and must be taken into account
    Marxism-leninism-maoism as the ideology of the proletariat; the
    Party as the leader of the revolution, the Peoples WaarywhIch in
    our case Is specified as a peasant war which follows the road of

    he basic question has always been the application of thisscience to the conditions of each revolution; consequently theproblem 1s the application oof Marxism-leninism-maoism to theconcrete conditions of the Peruvian revolution, and specificallne application of the universal law of violence, Peoples War, tothe revolutionary war in this country. From this fusion of
    Marxism with our concrete reality there arises and develops a
    Guiding Thought, that is, he application of Marxism-leninism
    Maoism to the concrete conditions of the Peruvian revolution. Inshort, our starting point is the outlook of the internationalproletariat, Marxism-leninism-maoism, and the Guiding Thoughtof President Gonzalo. These are the basis of all our politicaltheoretical and practical action; without this basis it is notossible to serve the class firmly and consistent
    Regarding the Part
    First let's look at the need for a party; then later when we take upits building we ll deal with its present role. Since its verybeginnings Marxism has held that there must be a Party to leadthe struggle to seize state power; this was reiterated by Leninismand emphatically reaffirmed by Maoism. Without a revolutionarparty of a new type, Marxist-leninist-maoist, there can be norevolution for the proletariat and the people. This is a great truththat no communist can evade without ceasing to be one, a truthwe Peruvian communists had to confront. The Communist Partyof Peru was founded on October th, 1928 on a solid Marxist
    Leninist basis by Jose Carlos Mariategui, who provided it withbasic theses concerning Peruvian society, the land question,imperialist domination, the role of the Peruvian proletariat, as
    welas programmatic points and a general political Ine and

    Mariategui and his line were openly put into question, and the
    Ine was changedby Ravines. Thus opportunism usurped Party
    leadership and imposed its authority in the two-line strugglewithin the Party with the gravest consequences for the class andthe revolution
    This road led to the parliamentary cretinism manifested in th1939 elections, in the service of thee comprador

    Mao's development of Marxism-leninism was known in the mid-1960s. This was the principal and decisive factor giving rise to theraction
    At the same time, a substantial basis for it was provided by thelevelopment of Peruvian society, the advance of bureaucratcapitalism, the sharpening class struggle of the masses, theintensification of political activity and growing propaganda aboutarmed struggle, and by developments in the region itself wherethe fraction arose, a region where the decrepitude of semieudalism was becoming Increasingly st

    where

Thedevelopment of Marxism-leninism by Chairman Mao and thegreat lessons and experiences of the Communist Party of Chinaplayed a vital and decisive in this initial process. Since then bothour initial commitment to Marxism-leninism-maoism and ourapplication of it to our conditions have developed further

    three periods, each with its corresponding political strategy
    1. Defining the problem of Reconstruction, guided by the politicalstrategy of"surrounding the cities from the countryside
    At this point the problem was to build a Party to lead the armedstruggle on this road, which meant that the peasant and landquestion acquired tremendous importance and it was vital to putthe Party,'s center of gravity in the countryside. Further, thedecisive question of ideological and political line centered onbasing ourselves on Mao Tsetung Thought, as it was said inthose days, and on"reclaiming and developing Mariategui, "withdevelopment being thele outstanding aspect of this. It was notenough to reclaim him for two key reasons: the development of
    Marxism-leninism by Chairman Mao Tsetung, and thdevelopment of bureaucrat capitalism in Peru. This phase tookplace during the struggle against Khrushchevite revisionism andits manifestations in various spheres of Party life and ended withthe January 1969 VI Conference which approved the

    This period was guided by the political strategy of "Reconstructthe Party in accordance with the Partys basis of unity. October1968 saw the coup d' etat of Velasco, who took on the task of
    eepenling the development of bureaucrat capitalism, carrying out

    the corporativization of Peruvian society guided by a fascistpolitical outlook and suppressing the rising mass movements
    This period divides into two parts: first the struggle against rightiquidationism, a form of revisionism which sought to destroy the
    Party by centering it on open, masses work and pushing it intolegalism; on the strictly political level this line put torwardexpropriating the land instead of confiscating it and above alldenied the fascist character of the government. When theseliquidationists couldn't take over the Party, they perverseattempted to destroy it and the fraction took up the Partysdefense. In February 1970 a split took place and the fraction
    assumed
    e eadersh1ip of the Party; from then on it led the
    process of Reconstruction. In the second part there was a struggleagainst "left "liquidationist, another variant of revisionism thattried to destroy the Party by shutting it up behind four wallsdenying the importance of peasant work and the possibility of anymass work because, according to them, mass work
    and
    organizations are impossible under fascism. They reduced fascismto simply a question of violence, and worse, to an irresistibleviolence in the face of which nothing could be done but wait forbetter times. They put forward the "relative stability of capitalism"and consequently of the social system. They said"the line is

    and

    further, and called Maoism into question, bragging

    advanced, especia
    regardinIg the understanding of Mariategui's
    thought and general political line synthesised for the first time infive basic points taken from his works as well as the necessity todevelop it further. The relationship between secret and open workwas delineated and the latter was developed according to the
    Leninist criteria of areas of support for the Party's mass workthus, mass organizations were created by the Party to develop thelinks between the Party and the masses
    3. The Culmination of the Reconstruction
    ThisPero
    od was guideed by the political strategy of"Culminate
    and Lay the Basis, "in other words, culminate the reconstructionand lay the basis for launching the armed struggle. With the
    untoldgof the process the Party was approaching
    the
    conclusion of its Reconstruction and so had to sum up what hadbeen achieved, define and sanction the general political line,continue the building of the Party on a national level with itscenter of gravity in the countryside, define the specifics of thearmed struggle and lay the basis to launch it by developing the
    work amon8the peasants. The left fought tenaciously to attain
    these objectives, waging intense and sharp struggle against rightism. This rightism developed into a right opportunist line thatfirst opposed the Culmination and then launched an onslaughtagainst the general political line, labeling it"ultra leftist, "andended up rapidly opposing the initiation of the armed struggle
    Nevertheless, with firmness and wisdom the left repeateddefeated right o1pportunlsm, another form of revisionism opposedin the last instance to revolutionary violence, to armed struggle, topeoples war, to the Party's fulfillment of its role of fighting toseize Dower for the proletariat and the

    A long chapter of the Party's history had closed and another oneopened the Reconstruction had been culminated and a new stagewould open, that of the armed struggle. It should be clearly andfirmly emphasize that during this period of the Culminationwhen Chairman Mao died, the Party pledged to the internationalroletariat and the revolution that it would always hold high the

In essence this plan held thatpeople's war in Peru must develop as a single revolutionary war inthe countryside and cities. with the countryside theprincipatheater of armed actions, following the road of surrounding thecities from the countryside.

    These figures show the yearly increase of our actions, as well asthose of the Armed Forces and their police assistants; theerlolicy's methods and even their genocide have not held back thegrowth of the armed struggl
    least as tar as quantity is
    concerned, according to the APRA Minister himself. Nevertheless,the total 6758 is very far from correct, firstly because of the state'srather understandable desire to minimize the dimensions of th
    the
    people s war, and secondly because they
    ey don't take into account
    all the various forms the revolutionary war takes, such as armedpropaganda and agitation, for example, nor do they count actionscarried out in distant and isolated areas. Consider that actionscarried out even in the department of Lima itself aren't reportedfor a week, and in general, a cover of silence and lies is used tomaintain the so-called public calm and the prestige of
    repressive forces
    During the six years of People's War 30,000
    actions have been carried out in all but two of the countrys 24departments, leaving out only Amazonas and Madre de Dios,while including even the constitutional district of Callao
    These actions developed basically in the Peruvian mountains andprincipally centered in the region of Ayacucho, Huancavelica and
    e. purimac. They also took place in the coastal region, in its citiesnd especially in the country's capital, and in the jungle highlandsand the important cities there; so the revolution is fighting420

    Important an

    qualitative advance. It should be made clear that more than half ofthe six years actions were carried out between June 1984 andtoday, and a third of the 1980-1986 total have been carried out inthe last year. This is the clear and concrete reality. What are thegreat results of the counterrevolutionary war, its genocide and its
    offensives oof 83-84? Obviously they failed; they havent even
    been able to hold back the development of the peoples war, letalone put an end to it
    Table 1 below, shows the four forms of struggle
    rough whic
    the Peoples War in Peru is developing. The prrincidal form IS
    uerrula warfare and the otherthree are complementary forms of
    guerrilla actions: sabotage, selective annihilations and armedpropaganda and agitation. It can be seen that 45.9% of the totalactions carried out in the country are guerrilla engagement(fought by detachments in the city and in the countrysideplatoons and companies), while sabotage only comprises 11. 2%and selective liquidations scarcely 8. 2%, and armed propagandaand agitations reach 34.1%. These figures clear show that guerrillawarfare is the essence and heart of the Peoples War in thecountry; it is significant that the percentage of guerrilla warfarereaches its highest level, 54. 4%, in the region of Ayacucho

    forward, because it is the form that most directly aims to destroy
    e enemy s militaryorganizations, especially the Armed Forces
    It is also notable that armed propaganda and agitation make upmore than a third of the actions. This shows the important
    People's War gives to politically educating and mobilizing themasses; obviously this work is directed principally toward thepeasants and in the cities toward the proletariat, and although inthe countryside it is mainly carried out in oral form, it iscomplemented b)y campaigns withPosters and illustrated leaflets
    This kind of work is most prominent in new areas, but it is givengreat Importance in all areas, occupying second place overa
    Sabotage, for its part, is in third place, with the aim of dealingeconomic blows to the reaction, especially imperialism and thestate economy, big capital and big landlords. In regard to thelatter, tearing down the

    extremely important to the peasantry. Finally, only 8.2% of thetotal is made up of selective annihilations ofenemies o

    As can be seen in these three tables the armed revolution carriedout only 8.4% of its total actions in Metropolitan Lima, while
    Car
    rying out 17% of allsabotage and 15% of thee armepropaganda and agitation there. These data disprove
    e so-caled
    retreat" or concentration of the revolution in Lima claimed bthe reactionary press, military chiefs and government authoritieswho seek in this way to give some basis to their claims that therevolution is suffering hard blows in the Ayacucho region, on theone hand, and on the other to give some explanation for theresounding actions which have shaken the capital in the last twoyears. An analysis of Table I shows that during thee twoyeearsstudied 60% of the work in Lima was directed at armedpropaganda and agitation, 23.7% at sabotage and only 3.8% atselective annihilations. Thus we can see from the percentages ofthe forms of people's war in Lima and their proportions inrelation to the rest of the country that the endless cliches aboutthe revolutions retreat are baseless fabrications. The point is thatbecause of conditions in the capital actions there have bigrepercussions the large-scale economic concentrations make largescale sabotage possible, such as the Bayer factory or the Hogardepartment store:; the
    central state institutions there can be
    sabotaged, such as the blows dealt to the Government Palace andthe Joint Command; foreign bigshots visit there, so there are
    occasions forbig blackouts such as the one that greeted the Pope
    obviously the central authorities are located there, so there areopportunities for selective annihilation such as that of Rear
    Admiral Ponce Canessa. Furthermore, the repercussionsimmediately sharpen the contradictions among the reaction thecase of this same Rear Admiral is an example while actions thereare more difficult to hush up due to the concentration of mediand the presence of international news agencies and all kinds offoreign representatives. Thus, the capital cannot be neglectedpeople's war, all the more if we keep in mind some international432

    Ambit and expansion. With the slogan"Stoke the bonfire, spreadthe flames, unleashes the class struggle of the masses especially inits armed form and let the repression spur us on, the spread ofthe Peoples War was taken up with the aim of drawing a

Thus the war was not conceived interms of one single region but in terms of simultaneous thouguneven development in several regions, with one of themprincipal ( which one that is could change according to necessity)all within the framework of a strategically centralized andtactically decentralized plan

    On July 13, 1985, the prisoners of war in the trenches at El
    Fronton, Lurigancho and Callao began a united struggle to winspecial prisoner status: in daring warrior actions they forced thelaunde government to sign an agreement and recognize theras such, with the rights that such status implies. ThiThis struggletook the government by surprise and dealt it a sounding defeatturnin
    he period of the transfer of the presidency to goood
    political advantage. The government prepared to get revenge. Thenew APRA government took charge of carrying this out; it
    Scarcely had taken office when it began to repudiate the
    agreement. A difficult and complicated struggle arose, with thegovernment trying to manoeuver and double deal; when thistailed it, cooked up and hatched the October 4th geenocidedeliberately unleashed a few days before the anniversary of the
    Partys founding, seeking to inflict a moral defeat on the prisonersof war in the trenches and on the revolution. But the Luriganchorisoners of war not only stood up to the genocidal attack withheroic daring; at the cost of their own blood, they turned itaround so it backfired on the government itself, and with classsolidarity, especially that of the other imprisoned fighters, thecelebrated October 7th with exultant revolutionary communistardor and exemplary optimism. They continued their struggle,and once again correctly pushing ahead the struggle, on October31st forced the reactionary APRA government to $1gagreement it had repudiated, only this time it was signed byhigher level authorities. But the struggle did not end and reactionnever ceases plotting and maneuvering against the sons anddaughters of the people. The government proposed the prisonerstransfer to Canto Grande to further its plan to wipe them out; in

These are united front committees that give concreteexpression to the joint dictatorship of the workersPeasants andbetit bourgeoisie, the three classes taking part in the armedrevolution today: the proletariat, the peasantry and the petitebourgeoisie. These peoples committees, taken as a system of stateare the concrete form of the New Democratic dictatorship whosesystem of government, in turn, is based on the peoplesassemblies. Although the national bourgeoisie is not taking partin the revolution now, its interests are respected. The Committeeis elected by

    War as a whole, and they have suffered the assaults of thecounterrevolutionary war. I hus an acute struggle is being wagedaround the new state power, between the armed revolution athe armed counterrevolution. For instance. thle struggle betweenrestoration and counter-restoration waged especially during theyears 1983 and 1984 is very significant. On this subject, it isworth pointing out that during the last two years the Peoples
    Guerrilla Army carried out 180 counter-restorations and inconnection with this sharp contention seized 591 towns. In shortthe vortex of the war between the Peoples Guerrilla Army andthe reactionary Armed Forces and police are the question of thenew state power, the creation, defense and development of theeople's committees, the base areas and the continuing advance in

    And what has been the cost in lives? The reactionary policy ofsetting masses against masses, of genocide and disappearances hasalready cost the lives of 11, 300 of our people. Adding to that the1, 668 dead of the Armed Forces and police, and police agents,informers, feudal tyrants and despots, and the 1,738 fallen of the

    Such being the state of things, the peoples war,the militarytheory established by Chairman Mao Tsetung, the masses war eby the proletariat is a great word of command for the present andor the future, within the age of wars in which the old andcaducous Imperialist and reactionary world order Is sinking andwill sink. The peoples war sets us forth two questions: 1)thepeople's war has universal validity, this implies that it is applicableto a democratic revolution as well as to one of socialist characterof course keeping in mind the own character of each one of thesetypes of revolution and even more bearing in mind the specificconditions of every concrete revolution in each country; 2)thepeople's war of universal validity is the answer to the imperialist
    world war, it implied at present anc

    thus, for the Communist Parties the prolem lays not in centeringthe attention on the imperialist world war but on the peopleswar, because only from the latter will derive the Political Powerled by the proletariat

Thus the reactionary beast drank blood to satietin order to impose its peace of the dead; the lives miserably andcowardly laid waste become immortal, forming the monumentaltrilogy of Shining Trenches of Combat of El Fronton, Luriganchoand El Callao, a historical landmark which will proclaim moreand more the greatness of the Day of Herotism
    The attempted devastating and decisive strike ended up falling onthe heads of those who engendered it, sinking the fascist andcoporative govrnment of ATPrista alongwith its president, whoviolated the norms of his own State, precipitating a grave politicalcrisis and a great loss of prestige which they still

    overcome. Thus the rebellion of the Prisoners of War, at the costof their own lives, earned for the Party and the Revolution amagnificent political, military and moral victory; moreover, theycontributed enormously to successfully sealing off the great leapith a golden seal and laying the foundation for the new plan ofdeveloping bases, whose first campaign has been the greatestshakeup the Peruvian State has experienced so far, and thegreatest repercussion of the Peoples War, both inside and outsidehe country. Thus, the prisoners of war, as historical figures, goon winning more battles beyond death, since, living and fightingwithin us, conquer 6 hew victories, we fee.
