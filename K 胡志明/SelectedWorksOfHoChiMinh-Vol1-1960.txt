    SOME CONSIDERATIONS ON THE
    COLONIAL QUESTION
    Since the French Party has accepted Moscowstwenty-one conditions(1) and joined the Third Inter-national, among the problems which it has set itself is aparticularly ticklish one- colonial policy. Unlike the Firstand Second Internationals, it cannot be satisfied withpurely sentimental expressions of position leading tonothing at all, but must have a well defined working proramme, an effective and practical policy.
    On this point, more than on others, the Party facesmany difficulties, the greatest of which are the following:

    Taking advantage of the Lingchen (40) incident and onthe pretext of ensuring the security of his compatriots, theBritish Ambassador in Peking has just carried out the firststage of this colonization. He has begun with the railways.
    Here are the proposals he has made to China:

    tern approved the twenty-one conditions put forwarda
    Lenin for recognition of the affliation of revolutionaryproletarian parties to the Communist International.
    These conditions forbade non-communist elements, theelements of the centre in the first place, from joining the
    Comintern, and laid down the fundamental polit

    divided it into three parts. The South ( now Nam Bo)became a colony under the name of Cochin-China, the
    Centre, Annam(now Trung Bo), was declared a Frenchprotectorate' by the King the North, Tonking(now
    Bac Bo) was conceded outright by the ki
    French, wbo ruled it directly. In I887 the French colonialists united these three parts of Viet Nam with
    Cambodia, and founded what they called the 'Indochinese Union. In 1893, Laos joined it.
